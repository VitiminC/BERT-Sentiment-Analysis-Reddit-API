How do I appease him so he won‚Äôt feel left out?",https://i.redd.it/x38vuuut95y91.jpg,"There was a video going round a while ago, same situation but dogs. And the guy got the bottle and went ‚ÄúSquirt squirt squirt‚Äù and rubbed the dogs ears, and it went off all proud and happy üòÇüòÇ",Fake putting the ear drops in his ears,"Lol, have the same problem with my babies. The older one needs medicine for their stomach issues and gets extra attention/treats as part of the process. The younger cat would get upset to at they were getting left out.
We started giving her ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù treats at the same time we gave the real medicine to the older cat as well as giving her the same type of attention (picking up, feeding from the hand). Now she‚Äôs super happy during that time. 
The older cat, however, is grumpy that she‚Äôs so dang excited during ‚Äúmedicine time‚Äù.","Might be worth asking the vet to examine other cat's ears as well, in case he's trying to tell you something?",Pretend to do it  without putting anything in ears,"Lol. 

Just pick up your younger cat and go through the motions without actually putting in ear drops.

If you tried already and he still does it then just take sometime to cuddle him and make much of him. He may just want some ‚ù§Ô∏è","An alternative to the water drops that cosplay1234 suggested, could be olive oil drops as these are commonly used in humans to soften earwax.

I expect that what it is is JEALOUSY. He is seeing the other cat get ‚Äúspecial hugs‚Äù and he wants some of that special loving as well.",Give treats to both after giving the drops to the one.,"Maybe wet a finger and stroke around the ear/eye so it‚Äôs a lasting effect?     
     
Edit; reading all the replies, I think you just have a silly brat of a cat.      
When my princess is being a dumbass I hold her upside down and rub her belly for 5 secs, turns on the zoomies and she forgets about whatever and goes burns off some energy for 5 mins, it‚Äôs great.","Use a cotton ball/tissue to wipe/rub the inside of the outer ear. They sometimes get earwax there anyway so it's not a bad idea to get them used to the feeling of having their ears touched. He might be looking for the pressure of the ear rub more than the""meds"".

 Also a good time to do paw pad and beans rubs. They get used to having their feetsies played with and they fuss less when getting their claws clipped."

2,guys he wont stop crying he‚Äôs like 2-3 weeks they gave him to me like this but i‚Äôm pretty sure he still needs his mom should i give him wet cat food? or milk and how do i give it to him,https://i.redd.it/zgankei3m2y91.jpg,"Go to your nearest pet store and buy kitten milk and a feeding bottle. You will have to bottle feed him for a little while longer.
Edit: keep him warm also","Hey. I just finished raising a 10 day old kitten to 2 months with a bottle and he went to his forever home yesterday. That kitten is too young to be without mom and you have a full time job now. It's really hard but rewarding raising them. He'll need feeding every 2-3 hours.

GET KITTEN WARM FIRST. This small, they can't regulate their body heat. Wrap a hot watter bottle in a towel or blanket and snuggle kitten near it. Leave room for it to move away if it gets TOO hot. It needs a heat source constantly for at least the next couple of weeks.

Then:

1. Get on Youtube. The KittenLady is your best hope. She has a video on how to identify neonatal kitten ages in weeks by checking their teeth, ears, eyes, weight and tail. Getting an idea will help you care for him properly.
2. Stimulate the kitten to pee and poop right away. Kitten's bladder could be dangerously full if it can't use the litterbox yet. Watch KittenLady's video on how to do this properly and gently.
3. You need kitten formula and a syringe or bottle. Any pet shop should have these. One part formula to two parts warm water. Test heat on your wrist. Watch KittenLady's tutorial on bottle feeding, she has tips that will help and you need to feed properly or kitten has risk of dying due to fluid accidentally going to his lungs. Kitten may not understand the syringe or bottle at first and fight against it. This is normal. Keep trying.
4. Clean kitten gently with a warm damp cloth. NEVER LEAVE IT WET. Dry before putting back in box with heat source.
5. Once all the urgent stuff is out of the way, kitten is fed, pottied, warm, clean and sleeping - call the vet. Get an appointment for dewormer and to see if he needs a flea bath. Get some pointers from the vet on how to care for him.
6. Keep taking care of kitten and research weaning, litter training, etc. KittenLady has vids on everything. Seriously. My kitten would have died if I couldn't access so much information so quickly on her channel.

You got this. It's hard work, but before you know it a few weeks will pass and the baby will be a proper cat. Running, eating solids, grooming itself, playing, and independently using the litter box.

If you think you can't take care of it, kitten urgently needs to go to a shelter.","He should be with his mom until 12 weeks - this isn't even just a little bit early to be away from her, it's way early.   As others have mentioned you need kitten formula if he can't be with his mom.",Google kitten lady she has a lot of videos and advice on the care and feeding of kittens,"Hi! So baby is absolutely too young to be away from his mom. For the next 3 to 4 weeks, you better be ready to be feeding him every 2 to 3 hours. Yes, that includes waking up at night to do it. You're also gonna need a little den to keep him in that'll keep him warm. Try to find a heating pad and put blankets over that in a box. He's going to need a certain kind of milk, called kitten milk replacement, or KMR. You can find it at petsmart or petco. You just follow the provided instructions on how to mix it up and you can use a dropper or a bottle. But I will tell you this. If you aren't willing to commit to that sort of routine (and that's fine, it is a lot), find a shelter to take him to. They'll most likely have fosters who specialize in what is called ""bottle babies."" You could take him to the vet as well. Don't be afraid to contact shelters and vet offices for advice, they may actually connect you to aforementioned fosters!","Who gave him to you, and where is his mom? I believe at that age he would need milk from his mom, another cat that's currently feeding kittens, or to be bottle fed a formula for kittens. He should be able to wean into small amounts of wet food and kibble soon but until then he needs to be bottle fed.",Please take him to a vet and learn how to care for a kitten.  Just like baby humans they take special care.  A kittens for dummies book or whatever will really help out and remove a lot of the guess work.,"Don't give the kitten cows milk - it will cause diarrhea and dehydration.  As other comments have stated, you have to get milk replacement formulated for kittens.","Do what everyone had told you. But also make sure you cuddle him a lot. He needs to be nurtured and loved. They shouldn‚Äôt be taken from their parents anywhere near that young. Is there anyway to get him back to mom, or is there another cat you know who could mother him. If not that falls on you. Trust me, you‚Äôll be happy you did it in the future when she is well adjusted and not crazy.",Youre gonna have to wipe hos bum to get him to poop a few times a day
3,Adopted a 4 month old kitten. How do I get her to warm up to me? (details in comments),https://i.redd.it/kibwg46kk6y91.jpg,"I've adopted a stray abused cat before, just leave her be, let her come to you.

I just did my thing, always treats near and her curiosity won. Took me two months before she was close enough for eating out of my hand. 

Placed treats near me, didn't move when she approached, let her eat it and then maybe tried to let her sniff my hand.

After tree months she sat on the coach with me and after that even on my lap. 

Lived with me for 11 years till she passed. Still miss her a lot.","I adopted this girl about a week ago from a shelter. She was originally a TNR (trap release neuter) and was probably a stray. She has been home with me now for about a week and hides about 90% of the day under my furniture and only comes out at night to eat or explore. She tolerates my dogs well but is very skittish of me. So far she's come up from about a few feet away from me but when I make a move she darts for it. I know it will take time, but what can I do to gain her trust?",Give her time. She will eventually warm up and you will end up being the only hooman she trusts.  She is precious.,"Time, patience and treats‚Ä¶

She is scared. Nothing smells right. Sounds are different. The food may be different. Your voice is different. 

Did that blanket come with her? If so at least she has something that smells and feels right.

You need to give her space and time. Do you have something soft that smells of you? A sock or warm jumper that you can put with her so that she has something non-threatening that smells of you. We got a box and cut a hole in it. Inside we place a soft cushion, my bed socks, and the ‚Äúblanky‚Äù from his old owner. He had somewhere dark and quiet that he could sleep in. We placed a litter tray in the room (I took a small amount of used litter from his old one), and he had wet food, dry food and water on an old rug outside his ‚Äúbed‚Äù.

Day 2, he would peek out. He had found the litter tray and used it. He had eaten some of the wet wood, and might have eaten some of the dry (some was on the rug). He sniffed my hand but that was it.

Day 3 he was outside the box when I entered the room. He didn‚Äôt rush to hide in it. I sat on the floor with a book and read it, ignoring him. He came up and sniffed me. Then he climbed onto my lap.","Food, the provider of crunchies is the most loved person",Literally just time. Just love her and let her go at her own pace.,"Don't look at her all the time. Especially not in the eyes. Play with her. Feed her especially delicious food. Keep her litter box clean. 

I had an abandoned cat I trapped and socialized. She was very shy. Go slow. Give her a smaller space than your entire home (someplace with a door and window). It took her a long time (a month+) before she decompressed. 

Let her get used to her smaller surroundings and widen her access once she is comfortable in her space and with you. 

Time is your friend here. 

Congratulations!","Best thing you can do is just leave her be.  Make sure she has plenty of food, clean water and a clean litter box and just let her come out on her own.  She'll eventually figure things out.","Slow and steady will win the race. Don't force her. You will just increase her fear and anxiety. Make sure she has a safe out of the way place with all her needs. Water. Food. Litter box. She will start to get used to the sounds and scents of the environment. 

I usually use a bathroom. This way the new cat feels safe and I can close the door decreasing unwanted interaction from other cats in the house. We have a few others. 

You can go in and use the bathroom without forcing interaction with the cat. This way she starts getting used to you and your presence. As she become more relaxed you can start ever increasing amounts of interaction, but if you force it to quickly then you could cause more fear and anxiety having the opposite effect of what you want. 

Once the cat feels comfortable with you then you can start leaving the door open and allowing them to explore the house openly in their own time. 

I've assimilated a few trapped cats using this method and it usually only takes a 2-4 weeks to get them fully assimilated into the house. It is very cat dependent though as cats have different personalities just like people and some are more outgoing and want to explore the environment outside their safe space immediately well some are more timid and take longer.","Let her come to you, take it slow and don't try to force interactions. 

Make sure you cat proof your home, cats love hiding in small dark and tight spaces and high places. The worst thing is for them to get somewhere they shouldn't be, or to find a hidey hole and never interact with the home. If you ever need a capture them, getting them out under a bed or behind the couch will be super stressful (and painful for you). 

But do give them a ""safe area"", like a second bathroom, where you don't really go into it. You could cover your crate with a blanket and put it in their room. This way if you need to take them to the vet you don't need to fight them to get them.

One thing that really helped mine was getting her a tall cat tree and placing it in the common area. Where she can observe and figure out what everything is about, from a safe space.

Also, talk to them, not necessarily directly at them, but when they're around just speak, talk about your day, read a book aloud, etc. Let them get use to the sound of your voice. Also don't make too many sudden movements. If they do make eye contact, slow blinking or calmly squinting is the cat version of a smile (a normal smile is a threat, since you're bearing your teeth).

It will take time, it might be a week or a month for them to come around. If she's been around humans before it will be much easier. But being 4 months old, she is well outside of the socialization period. So if she's never been around humans it will take time and patience."
