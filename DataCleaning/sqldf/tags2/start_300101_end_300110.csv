One morning my dad was backing out and she chased him down the driveway. She ran underneath his truck and broke her back. I spent that morning comforting her as she slipped away. The shaking and whimpers and the blood running down her mouth. The fear and pain in her eyes.

Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death. The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive.
