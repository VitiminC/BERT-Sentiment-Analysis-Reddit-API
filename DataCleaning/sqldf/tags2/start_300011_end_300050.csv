There is vertical and upwards movement all the time as in you are moving from one class/standard to the higher one. At times it resembles more of a pipeline movement as in once you enter the schooling system, there is a great likelihood that you will come out after clearing all the stages and the time of your exit is also defined. Although at a defined pace but there is progress all the time.  But after that it is all open. There is not much structure and not much pre defined paths. For some it is the absolute freedom and they can reach where their imaginations, efforts and capabilities can take them and that there is no limit to it. It is infinite in that sense. For some others, it is total cluenessness and they miss that structured and defined path. It is a struggle to figure out things and to keep moving upwards all the time and this might feel like stagnation.  Life is that open space only. When we are out there at our own and without the constant supervision/guidance of teachers and parents. And what we do in that open space is what defines us. ","[('admiration', 0.9696758985519409)]"

It looks like you’re trying to show a geared up plague doctor and a geared up modern healthcare professional. I’m no historian so I can’t comment on the acuracy of your plague doctor , but your modern kit has a few problems . I can go into more detail on that if you’d like. Subject-wise, as an ICU RN, there isn’t much of a parallel between the subjects. Used properly, adequate modern PPE is very effective at preventing the spread of diseases between us and our patients, while the plague doctors in full regalia were often disease vectors themselves. To be frank, they also had no idea what they were doing. Medicine of that era had neither the tools nor knowledge to actually combat disease, and there is actually debate over how many plague “doctors” were trained doctors at all. Tonally, well. it was indeed a very distinct uniform. And it inspired dread in those who saw them coming. If a plague doctor was walking around in your community, the plague had arrived. You or someone in your family was going to die. And as they shuffled house to house, they dragged the plague with them. It must have been terrifying. I certainly hope that’s not the effect we have on people when they see us or emergency responders in their neighborhoods. Drawing parallels between us and plague doctors is a tricky thing. To this day they’re associated with dread, death, and disease. Are you trying to show how far we’ve come and that we’re nothing like them? Or are you trying to say we’re the modern day equivalent of harbingers of doom that did more harm than good to their communities?","[('admiration', 0.997674286365509)]"

300031,"I enjoy the style, but the motion of the scooter is a little distractingly off. motorcycles utilize counter steering, which means they start a curve by steering away from it, then steer back into the curve once the center of gravity has shifted away from directly over the wheels. in practical application, this means the scooter will lean toward the camera while initially moving away from it, THEN come toward the camera as the lean straightens out. It doesn't lean into the direction of travel at the same time as it moves that direction. Hopefully that makes sense.

The quality is stunning but there seems to be great effort in the meaning behind the piece too I feel like it's suggesting a narrative link to the scarlet letter - adultery, conformity, guilt.

The red uniform ties back to the A and suggests the link is in education as does the book. The girls demeanor is depressed and exhausted, perhaps suggesting that the ""red A"" is something forced on her - she is taught she is covered in the red shame of the ""A"" and seems to have given in to this.
