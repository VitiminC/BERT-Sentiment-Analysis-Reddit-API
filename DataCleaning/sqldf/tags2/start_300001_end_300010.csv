The wheelchair is important because he grew very connected to it. By now we've had much more sophisticated speech synthesis, for instance, but the heavily electronic speech had become his voice and he wasn't willing to part with it. That brings me to my final observation which is that his chair wasn't a burden tying him down- it was an extension of his self which allowed him to express his mind and explore the world. What you've painted makes it seem like the chair was his burden.

300010,"Is it just me or is using native american symbols in art a little strange? Its not so much this painting is deplorable when looked at in isolation, but when all art with native american subjects and created by white people is viewed, some clear consistent patterns emerge in how native Americans are represented. I suppose native americans are often used in art because of our perceptions of the native american culture being more spiritual or connected to nature and land, more so than we currently are.  In art, we often dont really attempt to really understand the full complexities of either old or modern native american culture. Native american culture is much more than just about being connected to nature and stuff, its as complex as any other culture. Also, modern native american culture is very rarely represented by outsiders, which makes me feel more certain that we may be using symbols from a culture because of what we want it to represent, rather than trying to understand it. Why would this be bad though? Well maybe because it strengthens the perception of a culture as one dimensional and maybe even a little backwards while ignoring the technological advancements and large scale political and social structures that native americans had before we went in.  Even if the artist has a strong connection to native americans, I do think the average American viewer would not and that this painting could only strengthen an already preconceived notion of native american culture. Really, I think native americans may be used as a place holder so we can get in touch with our own ancestors, humanity, and spirituality. I think we all have an interest in our own ancestor tribes from thousands of years ago but by using native americans as a place holder for our own perhaps spiritual ancestors, we strengthen the misconceptions of native americans.  Currently, native americans do not live in similar conditions to their settled neighbors. Maybe understanding them as they are and not as what we want them to be may be a step towards furthering fairness and their liberties.","[('confusion', 0.9504378437995911), ('curiosity', 0.5723366737365723)]"

A lot of terrible and great things have happened since the days of nomadic land dwelling aboriginals in North America.
