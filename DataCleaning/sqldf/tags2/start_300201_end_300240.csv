I still don't think we deserve to live on this planet. We're like a virus to Earth, consume everything to extinction and only cause negative issues as a majority of the population. Imagine if we were taught to be understanding of our childhoods, be acountable for our actions, and hold a respectable level of responsibility to live on Earth. So many things we should've all been taught at an early age to care for nature and know that single-use plastics and unnecessary consumption and greed causes major problems like this. Indirect murder and we all share the blood of victims on our hands. These animals lives are more valuable than humans because they're at the mercy of monsters, and I don't think they would wish to share the planet with us if given a choice.  We always distance ourselves from animals like they're beneath us. It's quite sad. Every invention has made us lazier and less appreciative of how hard life used to be, the side affect has caused us to be numbed against emphasizing the challenge the natural world of survival brings. We don't respect it anymore because we've taken ourselves out of it, and now we're destroying it, which in turn destroys us. To not live in harmony with nature is a crime as Earth's one law is to respect its beautiful equilibrium.

This contrast is present despite the fact both sets are white, which is usually a way of describing something as dead.

300239,"I love the idea here. It’s also a very unique position to X-Ray from. Some constructive criticism Seems like it’s still in it’s early stages, try re making this work - you will definitely see improvements in your drawing the second time. Maybe even practice some light shading ? Edit  this is purely my opinion, I do not know if shading would make it better but it’s always worth it to try out adjustments. If it doesn’t work it doesn’t work - but why scratch out the possibility of making something that works really well? If the artist is happy with it - that’s all that matters. I feel like everyone is really focused on how things are ‘supposed to be done’ - why not find out what looks best? Art is not just about mimicking existing styles it is about exploration. Also it is basic knowledge that re-drawing an image for the second time will obviously have a higher chance of yielding better results. Unless your first attempt was a fluke - redrawing your work rarely every ends badly. I do it very often myself and that is why I offered it as advice.  Ps.

300239,"I am honestly so confused with how everyone considers this as good perspective and anatomically correct. I am here to provide constructive feedback and understand everyone else's opinions. If you can argue these points or would like to correct me, then gladly let me know. I also like your attempt at an incredibly hard and extremely heavy perspective pose. Feel free to take my opinions with a grain of salt. A few things to point out 1. The general perspective is skewed in two directions where the top half is heavily emphasized towards bottom planes while the lower half is more viewed at an angle from above and distorted towards the left. The lower half,  is just too flat with no circular cavity or depth. The Pelvis follows a bucket shape and if the Ribcage can be fully seen with its cavity open then the Pelvis should be too. 2. The anatomy of the Pelvis is not correct. It is not wide enough, as a general rule, a Female Pelvis will be near the position of the Acromion Process. A Male Pelvis will be as wide as their Ribcage in general, this can vary from person to person . It is too smudged together especially near the Pubic Symphysis, which indicates no 3-Dimensionality inside. The two Ischiopubic Angles go in widely different directions with no correlation to each other and in perspective. I should also be able to see the Sacrum and Cocyx at this angle. 3. The general drawing has no depth and looks very flat. A general rule to follow is considering to use basic shapes first when dealing with very dynamic and extreme perspective angles. Using basic shapes such as boxes is the easiest way to keep a relationship with perspective and think in a 3-Dimensional way because of its planes . Drawing first with the human skeletons very complex and organic shapes, especially as extreme as this perspective, without considering its planar areas will make it extremely difficult to create an overall drawing that is proportional, 3D, and complementary in both perspective and direction. I recommend lightly drawing in basic shapes that have clear images of planar areas that are easy to imagine in 3D to help aid in creating more complex shapes that get skewed with perspective. 4. The Femur is anatomically incorrect and it is difficult to see its connection with the Acetabulum . The right Femur is too wide with no indications or implied indications of planes, making it look flat. You would see a bottom and side plane on the right Femur at that angle. The Fovea Capitis is not present and is not socketed into the Pelvis . The Femur for the left is too straight. The Femur's Shaft is not completely straight but comes at an angle from lateral  to medial . I should be able to see the bottom, side, and front plane at this angle. 5. The Patella has no indications of its planes. The left Patella at this angle should show the bottom, front, and side planes. The right Patella is too large and incorrectly placed. It should be closer to the Tibia when bent. All I see is an extremely large bottom plane. I should see a bottom, front, and side plane at this angle . 6. There is no Fibula located next to the Tibia on the left leg. 7. The Spine in general looks wobbly and disproportionate to its actual shape. The Spine looks to be connected near the cavity of the Pelvis instead of the Sacroiliac Joint because the Lumbar portion is too large. The Spine follows convex and concave directions such as an ""S"" to keep balance. Here in this position, I should see only a fraction of the Lumbar portion of the Spine . Most of the Spine shown in this drawing to me looks like the Lumbar section because it goes in toward the Pelvis. What it should be is the Thoracic section, the largest portion of the Spine which connects the Ribcage . The reason as to why the Spine here looks like the Lumbar section only is due to it going in the wrong direction. The Thoracic section always follows a ""C' curve. Using full circles and perspective lines that go around the Spine can emphasize its cylindrical shape. 8. The top half of the Spine is unrelated perspectively to the other half being too skewed to the right and completely disappearing from view with the left missing a couple of organic-looking Ribs compared to the other side. 9. The Ribcage is probably the most difficult in terms to draw in perspective due to its complex system of small shapes and its very organic-looking shapes. Here is again where basic shapes are your best friend. Start with larger shapes first that is acurate in terms of proportion and perspective, making sure to keep an eye out on what 3D plane should be most visible from where it is viewed. In this position, the bottom plane is the largest. And with this large shape that has an acurate representation of planes, proportion, and perspective you can draw-in individual ribs that also follow that relationship. 10. The Ribcage is too wide. The widest part of the Ribcage is 2/3rd the way down from the overall shape. I also do not see much of the False Ribs connected to their Cartilage. There are 12 pairs of Ribs, 1-7 are ""True Ribs"" connected to the Sternum, 8-10 are ""False Ribs"" not connected to the Sternum and 2 ""Floating Ribs"" which are not connected at all to the overall Ribcage. The angle shown in this drawing will not feature all the Ribs though. 1. The lines look wobbly and shakey. The size is unequal for every Rib, either drawing larger to give more room for the Ribs or planning ahead will allow you to draw these small shapes with more precision, detail, and 3-Dimensionally. Draw the largest shapes first then work your way down. 12. I see too much of the Sternum, only a bottom plane would suffice. 13. There is no Scapula present behind the Ribcage. The Scapula is the ""Ball in Socket"" Joint which connects to the Humerus  which is not connected to the Glenoid Cavity. 14. Consider using larger more basic shapes for the hands and feet instead of drawing the Carpals and cylindersPhalanges individually first. Set up the planes and perspective then draw in the details for a more cohesive and 3D shape. Use rectangle first to set up their respective planes and perspective then convert them into cylinders for arms and legs. You can use light wrapping lines to convey direction, shape, and change in planes. I hope this helps in further improving your craft, good luck.","[('confusion', 0.9815505743026733)]"
