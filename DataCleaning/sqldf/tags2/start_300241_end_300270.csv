300242,"I like how the comments here are generally way more appreciative towards Michael Jackson than several years ago. People seem to respect him a bit more and that's only fair after all he's been through. It is sad though that it required his death to reach this point.  Michael was appreciated until somewhere in the late eighties but then the witch-hunt began. The public brought him to great heights of stardom but also was very eager to watch him fall. Still to this day; just look at how many people still think there's merit to those child abuse allegations even though during all the years of investigations there has never been a single shred of evidence to support those claims. Never. Or just look at the claims about the alleged bleaching of his skin, while his autopsy report clearly states that he had this skin condition called Vitiligo. This was exactly what he always gave as explanation for his skin colour change, but we didn't want to believe it when he still was alive.  Michael indeed was a bit strange. His mannerisms, excentrisities. But to some degree I think we can understand it's not easy to grow up with the whole world as your public. This crazy one of a kind stardom in combination with an abusing father is bound to be a recipe for strange behaviour to make up for a youth he never had. We can't possibly fathom how difficult the world must be when you're Michael Jackson. You can't trust anyone.  I'm not some biased fan by the way. His music is okay but I have a great deal of respect and appreciation for who he was. The whole situation always seemed so utterly unfair to me, I still can't wrap my head around it. He was this tremendously talented person who dedicated his whole life to making music and supporting charity, he was all about saving the world and the children and what not, and all the public wanted was to see him go down. He was the kind of guy who demanded from his management to completely renovate orphanages when visiting poor countries during tours and threatened he wouldn't go on stage if they didn't do it. Afterwards he would visit the children and give them all toys. And he did this all in secret. No cameras or media whatsoever, just him doing good things. And this is just one small example of many great things he has done. And he has done those kind of things his whole bloody life.  We honestly didn't deserve him.","[('admiration', 0.6128852963447571), ('sadness', 0.7060621976852417)]"

Also, the shadow seems like an afterthought, and that takes away from the wight of the bottle, making it seem a little ""floaty""if that makes sense.

Sensy Band or any other ""fidget"" band, I don't wear it since it feels gross on my wrist but it really helps with absent-minded fidgeting during movies, stress, bus rides etc 2. by far the MOST effective was a gummy multivitamin, they make your nails SO much stronger that they're harder to bite-through or peel. This 'interrupts' the behavior & makes you aware enough of it to stop peeling altogether, even cuticles. I recommend gummy specifically because I switched to a normal one for cost reasons & they're not ""fun"" or nice-tasting to eat, which makes me take them less & fingernails are back to breaking.

For what my dad told me, very few of them got the trust to sleep in the coop with the chickens, but one of the last dogs we had, ""Oso"" was his name, was so caring of them, that they started to sleep right beside him. One night, a pair of weasels entered the coop, when we arrived, he had killed both of them, but was covered in scratches and had a big bite in of his legs, my dad cleaned him until the vet arrived after 3-4 hours, he gave him a few syringes and bandages and told us that he needed rest. We had to put a lottle bed right beside the coop because he didn't want to stay put. Next morning, a bunch of the chickens where outside sleeping with him. He died a few years later just from old age. He was a very good dog.","[('caring', 0.7271834015846252), ('neutral', 0.7768385410308838)]"

Anecdotally, I have always enjoyed creating art and I've drawn and painted for years, but I've always struggled to visualize my original ideas. It's not a lack of technical skill, just the ability to visualize new concepts. I've been able to use AI as a tool to help create compositions that I can take inspiration from for creating my art. It seems to make art more acessible to a lot of people in that regard. It sucks for artists who make art their living, but it's great for the large number of people who've always had creative ideas but struggled to actually render them into artwork, whether it's because they lack technical skill or just the ability to visualize original concepts. Acessibility to the artistic expression of original ideas is the one major good thing I've seen from AI art. You could argue that artists have always made this acessible, but the unfortunate thing is that AI works in nearly an instant, is more affordable, and is easier to iterate on until you get an aceptable result. That said, I think it should be used as a tool at most, not as a means to create final products. I'm really not sure what the solution is. I like that DALL•E watermarks the artwork it creates to show that it's AI generated, not an artist's work, but that alone isn't enough to protect artists.","[('admiration', 0.3923528790473938), ('approval', 0.40234243869781494), ('realization', 0.505484938621521)]"

300270,"There is a great story of a guy who owned an iconic Rockwell. It's the farmer sitting with his son on the running board of a car and the son is dressed in a suit with a college sticker on his suitcase. It is called Breaking Home Ties and was used as a magazine cover in 1954, as many Rockwells were. It was supposedly donated to the Norman Rockwell museum but there was always a bit of concern because the painting didn't match the magazine cover quite correctly. For years art experts thought it was a conservator that messed it up but after the original owner died his sons discovered the actual Rockwell, along with other valuable art, hidden in a wall. Here is an article from when it was first found 13 years ago. The sons have since auctioned it off for $15.4 million dollars.","[('admiration', 0.8230172991752625)]"
