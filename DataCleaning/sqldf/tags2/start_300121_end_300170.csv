300122,"This is really interesting. Someone could literally kill themselves to make art and everyone would completely ignore the artist behind the piece. Except for the figure in green. Head down, breaking fourth wall. What's interesting is how the angles don't make sense. It's all surrealist based on how everything is delineated. The form of the fallen in relation to the art on the wall. The tool in the foreground. The angle of salmon pants coming towards the tool. The outside wall like you see at a park and this random artistically placed sheet of toilet paper set in the sky. The spatter.  It's like trying to be evocative and grotesque. Super scary and emotional. But honestly, the more I look at this the more comic it is. The meatball flowers under the fallen? Absolutely nothing on the silencer? No shell casing? Look at how long that reach is of the tool, plus silencer. The fallen would have to be barefoot to pull this with a toe even make that possible- and they're wearing shoes. The pseudo police badge resting on the upper crest of the hip. Is the idea to frame someone else in the image? I'd argue everyone else but the figure in green or the child. What's the recoil on a tool like that?  If this story is pinpointing a suicide, it's hard pressed to showcase this. The figure looks brought in later or moved by multiple parties, as the set and setting don't match.  In some ways, it's almost like a comment on ""coming of age"" and maturity. Maturation, adulthood, menstruation. Someone aging out of a stage of necessity and no longer feeling needed or useful as a guardian with the coming of age- hence the flower seen in red.","[('admiration', 0.9712551236152649)]"

People will internalize it, hyper focusing on symptoms rather than the causes, but that's inevitable because they have no other option when it's suddenly in their face like this. I was certain they'd be sad at my passing, probably go through the stages of grief, maybe do some good and/or some bad during their recovery, but ultimately I knew such an act on my part would only mark where one story ended in someone else's life. To some, the only significance that all of my life was in service of would amount to nothing more than a sentence ended too suddenly, way back when. This perspective is kind of why I'm still around. For as selfish as suicide can be, my ego did find a foothold to start the climb back up toward safety by leading me to believe that I was worth more than to be a melancholic frame in another's gallery.

And that would be fine if there was more use of shading or lighting but it all looks so bland. I get that the original doesn’t have tons of color but there’s still blue, white, gold, yellow, and rouge from the lipstick. The AirPod part seems tacky and dated contrasted with the timelessness of a pearl. Honestly, the model is great and she’s the only thing I actually like about the photo. Except her expression doesn’t come across quite right, but that again is the photographers fault.

No worrying about bills, or high stress jobs, if you're going to be able to afford to retire, or if you spent too long trying to find a life partner and now they're all taken up. They have nothing to pull them out of their happy, simple world. Everything in this painting really showcases the simplicity of youth. It's not the nostalgia of lost love that makes it so bittersweet, but the nostalgia for lost simplicity. When the summer came, and you had nothing to do but be young and alive. We could all find our loves, or our flowers, or our bicycles, but we can never get back the happy simplicity of youth, and that makes this painting so sad, while still being so happy.","[('admiration', 0.8199591636657715), ('neutral', 0.3761845827102661)]"

300145,"If you're looking for critiques, I'd say the overall piece feels a bit flat- theres no clear direction that the light is coming from. If they're outside, the effect of sunlight should give some strong shadows, for instance. As is, everything is lit equally, resulting in flat, dull light.  Additionally, I'd say if you're gonna do pieces featuring large groups of people, push details. Facial anatomy, clothing texture and variety, acessories, that sorta stuff. The postures have okay clarity, but for an ensemble subject matter, more details will convey the story you want to tell. Every person should tell a bit of their own story if we have only one frame to meet them  I'd say study norman Rockwell.

300167,"The image is fantastic. But it makes me wonder. All those images, movies, games and literature where this type of space-vessels are portrayed. How realistic are they actually, in terms of manufacturing them? We're talking thousands of square meters worth of thick metal plates being not only cut to shape and size, but also bent, curved and finally, welded or riveted. Well, it has to be welded in order to form a good seal but still. I don't think it's even remotely possible to have a huge enough manufacturing plant to produce most of those panels that we can see here. And think about the actual assembly time of the whole vessel. Even if we use man made AI robots and welders, it would take YEARS for such a huge thing to be made. To add onto that, a simple quarter panel of a car or a fender might require a stamping machine 20-30 times bigger in size than the actual part it makes, let alone the weight of the machine itself and the cost of the tools and dies. Additionally, we're talking about a ginormous amount of raw material, mainly iron, which needs to be made into hardened steel. Again, a massive amount of material and pre-production processes and costs.
