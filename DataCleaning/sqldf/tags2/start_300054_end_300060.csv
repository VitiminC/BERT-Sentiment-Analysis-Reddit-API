300054,"Not trying to be ""negative"" here but we can kind of see how this Bosslogic guy is really skimping on quality and is probably just trying to get views off this incident.

His daughter almost always has kept her hair straight, probably taking after her mom. Not a good piece of work in my opinion, he needed to spend a couple more minutes to do some research. Edit After looking through this guy's portfolio I can see now that he mostly does editing of real photos into art, but doesn't draw very much of his own work.
