Its a great tragedy, but I think we need a cozy room in the clouds to help us escape and to get us through today too. That isn't always a bad thing.

One of the issues with photorealism reproduced as a digital image is that the craftsmanship can be nitpicked because we're all probably looking at a relatively small image on a small screen compared to your canvas. Tricking the eye to believe it's a photo becomes more impressive when a canvas is larger, and part of the wonder of photorealist art is standing back at a distance where it totally looks like a photo, and then slowly walking toward the canvas and seeing where the artist skills create that illusion. I love seeing the ""breakdown"" point, because it's silly to think that a painting and a photo can be indistinguishable at every level, and so part of the experience of paint  depends on knowing the real size and the intended viewing distance. This isn't a comment on your work as much as it is a comment on the limitations of viewing painted works as a raster image. Keep up the good work!","[('admiration', 0.9993125200271606)]"

I put myself in the place of the girl  Her face is in awe. Look at what ive done! Ive created something so beautiful. It can recognise itself! It is self aware, what an amazing creation! I am so glad its alive! It is wonderful! Look how far it has come! So often I see myself as incomplete and I relate to that dispare. But seeing the look on the girls face and running with this naritive made me realize that to her perspective, the robot is a truly beautiful being. She is not concerned about the robot being incomplete but rather proud of how far it has come. The robot is beautiful, even though it would see itself otherwise. I have had other people tell me positive things about myself, but i never really believed them to be true, just something people say when they are greatful. They are not me so they dont really know. My empathy has only been for others and never been for me. This is the first time ive fully believed the oposite could be true. I am so glad this peice in in my life.

300096,"Goodness I love the nostalgia feel you added.  It's modern but it takes you to an old computer room too hot to wear a shirt even as the box fan in the window stirs the atmosphere. Particles of dust and thick tinted smoke glint off the few rays of sun that catch the heavy air, only to be disturbed by the ocasional movement of a hand flicking ash into it's already burden tray of discarded butts stained by lipstick and cola. Somewhere beneath the L-shape of the distressed wooden work station, yellowing tomes containing the manuals to long forgotten operating systems and graphic design programs are weighted down by an overfed but well loved cat that lazily drifts from cluttered shelf to keyboard as it sees fit.  Nothing in the room seems to have been disturbed in years and yet a solitary person makes their way day in and day out from dim hallway to said desk, a steaming mug of black coffee in hand not unlike the thick sludge produced at the greasy spoon down the street, to slouch at the only immaculate thing in the room- the computer.  It has always been this way. The cat, the mountains of scratch paper with hastily scrawled notes done in a frenzy of thought, the pad of sticky notes that collected enough dust and fur to not work for their intended purpose; but the computer itself remained a pristine fixture amongst the chaos.  It however was not chaos.  Creature comforts such as this room are necessary in such a throw away society; a room where ideas were hung on cork boards with care and the past was preserved so as to not lose sight from where once we came. A room where the only sound of distress exuded was either made by ancient fans being powered on in nicotine stained chassis or a fist beating the heavy desk when human error met it's match against machine.  It has always been and always will be, the computer room.","[('neutral', 0.9021590948104858)]"
