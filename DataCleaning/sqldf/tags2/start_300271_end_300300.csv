Not sure why / what I'd change, maybe push the bottom of the clouds back by making them more bluey grey, maybe bring the hills forward by warming them up or something, idk.

300289,"Hi, it's very nice, but i have some constructive criticisms. The water does look a little viscous. For example, oil has a much higher refractive index than water so i think it's possible to reduce the viscous look by slightly reducing 'warping' effect as water wont refract the light that much as it appears in your painting. There's also like a buildup of goopyness around the mouth, water has much less resistance to flow and wouldn't build up as much like that. Also the shoulder looks very 'warped' from the water, in this scenario the shoulder might only get slightly wet which would only leave a very thin film of water on it meaning there wouldn't be any real visible distortions from light refracting which is why it looks a bit weird to the eye. Here's a reference photo where you can kind of see how water can appear when falling on someones face.  Hope i didn't sound like negative person, it was just my observations.","[('admiration', 0.9891207218170166)]"

Spoke of fondly in the county of Bunninghamshire, he always bids the women a good day with a gentle lick on their paw before continuing on his morning hop down to the fjords. He does not dip his feet, for it causes great disdain within him, but he likes to admire the dandelions across it's edge for they are the finest dandelions in all of Bunland. Sir Bunnington's wealth came from his fathers farming of such dandelions and leaving him a hefty sum to keep him comfortable during his lifetime. Married to Lady Bunnington, he has twelve kits left from the original set of fourteen, where two unfortunately perished to the great and devious King Foxington I, who has taken bounty from the land in the means of children. The oldest of his kits, a buck, was given his fathers name as first born, and plots to overthrow the monarchy in vengeance of his stolen siblings. This is the last, and greatest painting of Lord Bunnington XIV - nobody knows to this day what came of the family, only rumours that say they got on a ship to Bunica in search of a fear free life.","[('admiration', 0.9964710474014282)]"

300295,"An Autumn day when winter whispered warnings on the wind A band of tiny travellers came bobbing down the bend Purposeful perserverance formed the features on their face There are few who know among us What event that may have brung us To behold these fellow fungus Onward steering through the clearing, seeking out a better place. If fortune flys they'll find a fallen log to feast upon But none are near for nib'ling so the mushrooms travel on Convenient could a corpse appear, that they might decompose They searched until the hour was late But none who met a grizly fate Did find itself upon their plate So packs on backs, devoid of snacks, the mushroom journey goes. Poor Emmanita cried, her little legs could take no more The family wondered if it's been this bad before. ""I haven't seen the likes of this, since I was but a spore."" Old Grandpa Cap said, reminiscing of the things that he was missing while weary mushroom feet went hissing As they pass through grass that grew upon the ancient forest floor. The mushrooms kept on moving, though the going may be rough Basidiomycota carries on when things are tough When other growing things give up when faced with such frustration When times are hard, and luck has thinned and Winter's just around the bend They spread their children on the wind When snow has passed, they'll spring up fast, the mushroom relocation.","[('neutral', 0.9968409538269043)]"

I got there early to review my notes and sat beside a girl Ive never seen before. The test starts and after a few minutes the proctors move to the front of the class. This girl slips off her flip flop, removes the text book from her bag and deftly with her foot turns to a few reference pages with such dexterity and skill she has to have practiced prior. She sees that I noticed and gives me a smirk. I also smile indicating I don't care and get back to my test. A few monents later after hiding her book under her bag with the same ability from the proctor she returns to it going to a rather useful index for this class. I smile again impressed but stay on my task. She then taps me with her foot and slides the book under a seat where I can see it and it could be hidden quickly in case the proctor returned. I did reference the chart to check my work but didn't really need it. I don't remember ever seeing her again but I'll never forget how good she was at moving acurately and without looking suspicious with a single foot.
