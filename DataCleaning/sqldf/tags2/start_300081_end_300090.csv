How does it compare to doing more “traditional” art? Do you feel like you are expressing something by doing this? It obviously shows a lot of skill, but do you have anything to say with it? As I write this out, it sounds dumb or maybe insulting to ask. But you said elsewhere it took you 10-15 hours to do this. Presumably you could do an oil painting or watercolor in half that time, and still have an artwork that feels warm and vibrant, but not nearly as realistic. Does the hyper realism add some meaning for you, or is it just for its own sake? I do enjoy the drawing a lot. I’m just curious about the thought process behind it.

The whale, tortoise, and lion are all wearing crowns. What are the significance of thise animals to you? The cranes holding banners are amazing. ""You can only expect to be surprised."" ""This could be the start of something great."" Why are these phrases significant to you? The bottom left ships wheel hits home for me. The background being octopus adjacent is incredible. What inspired this panel? What do those images mean to you? The bottom middle with the koi and slug is very appreciated. The contours are rich. Is there a transition from larger sea animals to smaller fish? The bottom right seems to counter and match the overall theme at the same time. I enjoy it. Is the crucified character from something else? Who do you identify the character as? Who is ""Vlad"" and why do they like toast? What did the koi experience as it seems very surprised. The center caribou and horse playing guardian to the lion, again, hits. This is absolutely amazing. What does the ""18"" mean to you? What does the infinity symbol mean to you? Why is the world is centered on Africa? Why is the moon bound in banners? As an artist who put hours of effort into this, I honestly want to know what each pen stoke, image, and symbol mean to you. Why did you make this piece? You are gifted but clearly with a purpose. If you would be willing to share your inspiration I would be very interested. Either way, well done.
