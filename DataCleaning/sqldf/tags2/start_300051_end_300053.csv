300052,"The Wizard Cafe was a prestigious restaurant. It took months to get a reservation and even then, only those individuals with the finest manners were allowed to dine there.  Amanda had been waiting for eleven months. She'd won a gift card in a potion contest and had eagerly counted the days to when she could go. She had even brushed up on fine dining etiquette and dressed her one of her non-scorched marked dresses.  She arrived three minutes early to her reservation and was promptly brought to her table where she ordered her favourite dish, and the one the cafe was famous for Creme Brulee. As she sat, a waiter brought her coffee, sugar, milk. He also placed the brulee on the table. Seconds later, another waiter appeared with a small green dragon curled perched upon a purple napkin.  The waiter stroked the small dragons back and it made a purring sound before the dragon spied the creme brulee and the waiter lowered his arm. The little dragon drew in a deep breath before he blew a small, blue, flame across the top, caramelizing the dessert.  Amanda held her breath, her eyes wide, until the little dragon finished as sat back, giving a small cough; a little puff of smoke drifted from its mouth. The waiter stroked its back again.  ""Enjoy,"" he said and slipped away back into the restaurant.  Amanda picked up her spoon and gently scooped into the dessert, breaking the top of it. She brought it up to her mouth and took the bite, almost melting in her seat. It was delicious; smooth and sweet. No wonder the Wizard Cafe was famous across the twelve realms and it was worth the wait.","[('admiration', 0.982813835144043), ('realization', 0.3936719596385956)]"
