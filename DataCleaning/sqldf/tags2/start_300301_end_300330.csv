300302,"So fantastic.  And the title is perfect, as it immediately makes you relate to something in your own life that fits it. And the longer you think about it, the more you find.  First instinct was when I took my nephew  to the park, and a strange dog ran up to us. “Oh, he’s fine, he’s friendly!” Said the owner, as the dog did a running jump and latched onto my nephews arm and I was forced to subdue the dog.  Then later in life, the friend of a friend who everyone insists is a great guy, until they all leave and you’re alone with him and suddenly consent isn’t something the “friendly” one cares about. But it’s hard to come forward about the violence, because “ah, he didn’t mean any harm!”  Then, later, the boss that wants to help you with your career. Wants to mentor you. Such a sweetheart.  But the second you object to the hands on you or being used as a scapegoat or thrown under the bus, “awe, but Amy is so nice, she’d never treat you wrong! She’s just a sweetie.” It relates so hard to a lot of stages in life and interpersonal relationships.  Absolutely well done.","[('admiration', 0.9975274205207825)]"

300302,"This art makes me feel pity for the wolf. He does not choose to be carnivorous, he was born that way. The sheep is surely a victim but so is the wolf. Not only must he endure brutally taking the life of another in order to consume their flesh, but he must think to the future and plan his next meal. One life, one body, is not enough… never enough. The wolf, knowing only killing, sees no wrong in their actions. We are emotionally overwhelmed at the idea of living such a life. Yet we are the wolf. Our sheeps’ clothing is neat and free of blood stains despite their equally brutal origins. Yet we are the sheep; Blind to the wolf’s disguise.","[('realization', 0.9443590044975281)]"

Also, the lines from the fruit and the white label all seem to converge at the same point, which hurts the composition a lot. I think that the wine glass, the drapery, and the bottle all look great.
