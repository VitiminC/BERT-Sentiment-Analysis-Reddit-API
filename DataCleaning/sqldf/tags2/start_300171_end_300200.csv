300178,"Please excuse the length of this comment. This image captures him so well, I felt compelled to share. Thank you OP. I’ve never shared this thought process before, so I do hope I manage to convey it satisfactorily. I grew up watching Robin Williams. He was, is, and always will be, my favourite actor. I have sought out and watched almost every film, TV show, and stand-up special he made . I even managed to see him perform live while I was living in Sydney, something I never expected to get to experience while I was growing up. There was something amazing about Robin, and every performance he gave. I never identified what it was that drew me to his work - I don’t think I ever wanted to, for fear understanding how it worked would ruin the magic. I don’t work in the film industry, but I’ve always dabbled in screenwriting. It’s always there, as a distant someday-maybe-one-of-my-movies-will-get-made kind of goal. A hobby. And, inevitably, characters would show up in what I was writing that would become Robin. It was never intended, but would emerge despite my intentions for the story. The more I wrote, the more that back-of-my-mind goal started to include not just making a film, but making one with Robin. It never really felt like a pipe dream, despite how glaringly obvious that title should have been. When I heard the news of his passing, I couldn’t believe it. I was in shock. The world was instantly a darker place. A sadder place. I struggled to watch his movies. As time passed, I came to realise that the world didn’t get darker, or sadder - at least not in the long run. I was mourning the loss of what Robin may have created in the future. I was mourning the fact that the world wouldn’t continue getting brighter, not that it had gotten darker. And seated underneath all of that, was the admission that I would never make a film with Robin Williams. A selfish reason to mourn? Certainly. But we can’t always decide how we respond to things like this. The more I thought about it, though, and the more I started to write again, a realisation grew. One that helped me finally watch his movies without sadness, without missing Robin. I realised that I might never make a film with Robin Williams, but I realised that I would also never make a movie without him, either. The inspiration, the motivation, the genuine joy, that Robin Williams provided, is an integral part of anything I write. And should anything I write, one day, ever get made - then it obviously won’t star Robin Williams, but it will owe its existence to him, in a very significant way. And for that, Robin Williams, I thank you.","[('admiration', 0.7950049638748169), ('desire', 0.35022830963134766), ('gratitude', 0.9930082559585571)]"

300184,"Im going to give you some improvement criticism not because the work is bad. Its excellent. I really thought the reflection was real, as are the mudboots. You have a real gift with glossy surfaces.  Now the matte surfaces like the blue pants and coat seem a bit flat just because the detail doesnt seem to be there, as compared to the rest of the piece. Now maybe its intentional to get the viewer lost in the reflection which would be good.  But if you put a little more detail there I dont think it would distract from the fantastic puddle. I might suggest harsher sharper crinkles in the stiffer material. That might be a good contrast. Again this picture is like a 9/10, Im just trying to figure out what might work for a 10/10.  I could never get water colors. Im more an oil color person because when I eff up I can just scrape it off. Which is often.  The fact that you did this in WATER COLORS means you did this once and it was excellent, very little room for improvement because your going to plateau at awesome.","[('admiration', 0.9934778213500977), ('approval', 0.6113419532775879), ('realization', 0.31659120321273804)]"

300199,"Holy moly so much better than contemporary. Edit sorry I didn't mean to put anyone down.  To clarify I spent the weekend in London a few years ago, visited the British Art Gallery and and the Tate Modern. I just was completely absorbed by almost every pice in the British Gallery, every painting projects powerful emotions, weather it's an epic surrealistic vista with hundreds of detailed figures or just a woman's face with the most real looking glassy eyes you can just stared at them for hours. I'd didn't know how vibrant paint could be. There abstract scenes, hyper real painting of demons 20 ft tall, landscapes with entire storys that are so big you feel like you're standing in them up close.  I just never realized what this kind of art was like to see in person and it completely change my perspective. I personally feel like the purpose of art is to convey emotion with sound, vision, even scent and touch etc. I just felt a lot more that at the Tate but it might be just me.
