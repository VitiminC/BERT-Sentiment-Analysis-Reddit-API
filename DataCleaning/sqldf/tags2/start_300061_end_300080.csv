300072,"A truly moving commentary on the ephemerality of life and death. The artist's chosen media - salt and wood - sets up a thoughtful juxtaposition of the deep sea, unknowable and unnerving, with the familiarity-verging-on-banality of cut, planed and varnished wood. The piece asks us to consider our fears, and examine the structures of value and mortality beneath them, as the grain of the table shows through the very flesh of the shark. Doing so, we may see that we live in a world where even the very real and visceral fear of prey sucumbing to a predator feels unimportant; and if death is no more tangible to us than a pile of salt, what is there to fix life in place for us?","[('curiosity', 0.5639286637306213), ('realization', 0.5283008813858032)]"
