4,"I may not be the biggest fan of your music, but I am forever a fan of you.

Thanks for being such a good sport with the internet.  It can be a hateful place, but you have inadvertently (or maybe it was your plan all along) created one of the longest-running, formidable, and hard to see coming memes/trolls of the digital age.

For that, we immortalize you in a way most people can only dream.  We thank you and we honor you at the same time."
5,"Hey Rick! 

My dad used to work with your brother in law at an aerospace place in Wigan. He's only ever heard good things about you, which means I've only ever heard good things about you. I just wanted to say hello. So, hello!"

His name is Chad"

17,Am I late to see this mr Astley?
18,"Man, if only I could get a reply from Rick Astley"
19,It’s hard to look serious while riding a yellow bike.
20,Just popping in here to tell u/ReallyRickAstley that he is genuinely a great guy and I still cannot get over the [video with Foo Fighters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdkCEioCp24)

23,"This will never be seen by anyone, but I’m posting this comment to be apart of history"
24,"Hey Rick,

Obviously shit's been hard for a lot of people lately, but I just wanted to say thanks personally. I've been under a lot of stress and it's been hard on me mentally lately, these little breaks from reality just to have some fun really helps."
25,"The ultimate rick roll.

What’s your take on the whole rick roll thing?  Do you like it or is it annoying by now?"
26,"Jeans and denim jacket, yea, definitely the 80s."
27,Fuck...I came in late...but I was here when this happened... fucking legendary.
28,The amount of awards  [u/theMalleableDuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&feature=youtu.be) got is insane. I have never gotten any.

32,"Can someone explain the panic over toilet paper recently? I understand that it's somehow COVID-19 related, but were people not wiping their bums before the virus was a concern?"
33,These dudes look like heavy shitters though
34,"My absolute favorite thing about this is that while every store in a 10 mile radius around me is sold out of TP, they all still have plenty of hand soap.

Priorities."
35,Every couple of weeks I go to Costco to buy TP for my workplace - it is a remote construction site with a crew of over 70 people. I usually buy three Kirkland packs at a time - and now I am dreading my next shopping trip cause I will look like a complete and utter idiot.
36,Panic at the Costco
37,When you're an asshole you need a lot of TP
38,If this is you: why? What the hell do you think is about to happen? Do you anticipate pissing out your ass for the next 3 straight years?
39,"I just don't understand this, at all. People act like the supply chains have shut down and no more TP is being made, you fucking idiots realize there's another semi, on the way, WITH MORE TP, WATER AND RAMEN RIGHT? 

Even in Italy and China where we've seen the worst of this so far, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THEY COULDN'T SHIT? NONE. You know how many people have reported they couldn't shit because some asshole bought all the TP? A LOT.

Buy a bidet everybody, it's on Amazon for like $30 and you'll only need like 2 squares of TP for every shit after that, for eternity. If your store is out of lysol wipes, buy the spray bottle and use a cleaning rag. If they run out of bottled water, buy a filter for your tap.

Jesus, everybody who's panicking and doing all of this stuff, just stop. Think about the community at large and how you're impacting it."
40,I’ve tested positive for corona??? But how is that possible??? I bought so much toilet paper!!!!
41,"I would be embarrassed as fuck buying two packs for self isolation for my family of 5 let alone 10.  
Fuck these people..."
42,I have a few rolls left. I am wondering what I am going to do in a few days.
43,"Bidet gang represent!



Edit: it seems the best bidets on Amazon are sold out  I WONDER WHY!"
44,"~~My~~ A town has a seniors lodge that is currently outsourcing toilet paper from local residents, asking each household to donate a couple rolls. They shouldn't be in this situation in the first place.

Edit: Not my town, turns out, but a nearby one. Local Facebook groups aren't the greatest for accuracy. Point still stands.

Edit2: [Someone's taking it personally](https://ibb.co/ZMs1TTd)"
45,I’m literally just in the market for toilet paper like usual...and can’t find a single fucking roll
46,"Stores should be responsible and put limits on how many you can buy

Wow 2k upvotes and an award! I never thought my best comment would be about toilet paper ??"
47,"I feel like the people who buy all the toilet paper are not the people who would survive a real apocalypse.

Edit: Damn, first award kind person!"
48,"Me and my roommates are ACTUALLY out of toilet paper and can’t find it anywhere. In Austin. Where there are a grand total of two people with corona. FUCK THESE ASSHOLES.

>“The size of toilet paper makes it feel like a substantial, big  purchase. It makes it feel like you’re doing something. It taps back  into that need for control. If you’re buying a hefty big pack of toilet  paper, you kind of feel like you’re ‘stocking up’. You signify to  yourself that you’re in control.”

Meanwhile everyone with a bidet has a smile, and not just from the bidet.  :)  People hoarding toilet paper concerns me, a little.  I'll become worried when there's a shortage of penicillin and hamburgers."
50,"FFS, how much do these people think they are going to shit?

EDIT: I would never have thought in a million years that one of my highest rated comments would be in a post about hoarding toilet paper."
51,Except for that dude on the left. He looks like he drops them huge shit hammers that just go KERPLUNK.
52,"My buddy works at a sporting goods store, and when their limited supply of TP ran out people literally started buying up all the guns and ammo"
53,"The supply chain is fine - the stores are fine its all the panic shopping that clears the shelfs  - normally the shelfs are enough for a 3-4 days so that swhat the trucks bring .  

When people come in all at one and clear the shelfs - they stock them same day and clear them again - it will be next day at worst 2 for them to restock but all of sudden their are pictures of empty shelfs and people panic even more and go into a buying frenzy and it just repeats - there is more then enough for everyone and if you didnt buy 10x more then you need for your selfish self theere would still be enough for everyone and then some and there would be no panic. 

&#x200B;

This panic is 100% caused by selfish ignorant people over buying , and half the stuff they overbought will go to waste"
54,Can someone explain to me why people are stocking up on TP’s? People have gone mad.
55,i work in a grocery store and today was probably the worst shift ever in my 3 1/2 years there. idiots

61,"The pest control guy.  Horrible story. I’ve seen the video too. it’s so fucked. He was intoxicated, got shouted at with contradicting commands, and was just some kid begging for his life"
62,"*Police Sergeant Charles Langley then ordered Shaver, who was lying prone, to cross his legs. Moments later, he ordered Shaver to push himself ""up to a kneeling position."" While complying with the order to kneel, Shaver uncrossed his legs and Langley shouted that Shaver needed to keep his legs crossed. Startled, Shaver then put his hands behind his back and was again warned by Langley to keep his hands in the air. Langley yelled at Shaver that if he deviated from police instructions again, they would shoot him. Sergeant Langley told Shaver not to put his hands down for any reason. Shaver said, ""Please don't shoot me"". Upon being instructed to crawl, Shaver put his hands down and crawled on all fours. While crawling towards the officers, Shaver paused and moved his right hand towards his waistband. Officer Philip Brailsford, who later testified he believed that Shaver was reaching for a weapon, then opened fire with his AR-15 rifle, striking Shaver five times and killing him almost instantly. Shaver was unarmed, and may have been attempting to prevent his shorts from slipping down.*


This was just terrible to watch, beyond awful."
63,"I saw the video on LiveLeak, the cop give him conflicting commands and shot him on purpose.

""Put your hands up, now crawl towards us, keep your hands up or we will shot you!""

I thought ""Okay, I need to watch this because I understand that police officers sometimes have to make a decision that could possibly result in their or a colleague's death (I'm UK so armed police is NOT an everyday occurrence and we/I expect higher training and decision making abilities from SO19 than we do from regular police)""

67,[here’s the Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Daniel_Shaver)  of the story. A fucking disgrace.
68,The “You’re Fucked” engraved dust cover on the rifle used to murder Mr. Shaver was not admissible as evidence.
69,"This is fucking grimm, getting away with murder, avoiding jail time and then getting paid for it. Seriously the world is fucked sometimes. Hope this man gets what is coming."
70,He was from a small Texas town and had two daughters. I’m sure those cops didn’t lose any sleep over what they did. I can only hope they are given the same respect when they die.

72,"The murder of Daniel Shaver is the single worst thing I've seen on the internet, and I've seen quite a lot. The mixture of absurdity with this deadly game of Simon Says, along with the knowledge that this is happening in ""the greatest country on Earth"" was appalling. The resolution to this story made it even worse.

American Police is morally defunct."
73,"Anyone outraged by Daniel Shaver should learn about [Tony Timpa](https://youtu.be/_c-E_i8Q5G0)

76,"I remember this video. I think of all the terrible ones that were released it was the hardest to watch, because the whole thing was filmed with clear sound, and you could see the whole thing unfolding over several minutes.

I see this video and still cannot understand how a jury would just let the officer who executed him on video go."
85,Brailsford is an absolute psychotic cunt who was out for blood that night. I swear he did everything in his power to ensure he could murder Shaver and he belongs in a cell for the rest of his life.
86,"What a horrible frickin' shooting that was. This was plain old murder. No justification whatsoever. Guy was on his knees, pleading not to die, trying to listen to the conflicting commands and they still killed him. The guy giving the commands fled the country and the other is receiving a 30k pension for life due to this shooting. Is this justice? Is this law and order? Who does this protect and serve?"

He should not have the right to stop working class people from trading securities in a free market to protect his interests.

100,"I've been saying since this happened, this was the closest people got to fixing the problem of unequality. Notice that this protest is never brought up, it has practically been scrubbed from media because in my opinion it hit the nerves of the people that are the problem. That's why as soon as they thought it was out of control they cleaned the streets up in a night. There were no racial tensions, there was no fighting no burning in the streets, but that didn't stop them from coming in and arresting people and emptying the streets up. But they couldn't keep people out of the Capital?



Edit: Thank you for the gold. I wish I could reply to everyone but I'm really overwhelmed with the amount of comments. 


So to paraphrase

1 OWS was the closest now WSB is on mark.

2 OWS lasted weeks, but when banks got scared, government stepped in, police cleared the streets in a night.

3 racial tensions/sjw became the new focus and OWS disappeared from media

4 media works for government works for banks.

5 OWS would have worked if it had direction and leadership

The 99% are using technology, capitalism, and a free market (hahah no, because trading services wouldn't let us trade) to use hedge fund methods against themselves.  They got beat at their own game and lost big time and a lot of that wealth was redistributed amongst the lower class.  And what did we do....We paid off student loans, bought houses, some people are going to start businesses.  We took that money and actually do things that boost this economy instead of allowing a few dudes to hoard a couple more billion so their net worth is more impressive."

- Recessions are horrible for the average person. 

- For the wealthy, they're a BOOM. They buy up everything, wait out the storm, and sell for a profit -- or just hold them and lease/rent like monopoly.

- What gets rich people jumping out of windows is inflation -- when their money is worthless.

It's all a fucking game for them; and when you have that much money you can live off interest, let alone weather troughs in the economy and smooth out those rough periods.

I could've been a programmer and game designer by now! Yet I had to spend years finding ways to get money to even live a half decent life again, and that's after I was done with 6 years digging through supermarket trash for food. I'm 27 now and I'm currently struggling learning how to program while having a shitty day job."
113,"The biggest takeaway from the whole WallStreetBets bonanza is that if you give normal people the same information as Wall Street, they can and will use it just as effectively as the best fundamental investors.

I've spent the last year writing code to get data that Wall Street pays thousands of dollars a month for and making it available for free. My thesis has been that normal people are just as good as, if not better then, Wall Street at evaluating stuff like social media trends and the last week has been solid evidence towards my case.

There are countless hedge funds that could have identified and profited from the same opportunity before WallStreetsBets had the chance to get in, but they didn't. The only thing keeping them on top is the fact that they already have money.

That's scary to them, which is why we're seeing what we're seeing."

151,What does this particular spot mean to you and your wife?
152,"I am the one preparing to leave the love of my life after 19 years of marriage, as the cancer is bearing down on me now for the 3rd and looks like final time. My heart breaks - not for me, but for my love and best friend whom I have no choice but to leave behind, alone.

OP is there one thing you wanted or needed to hear from your beautiful wife that she didn’t say? It needn’t be anything profound, just something extra that would have helped your heart heal. I don’t want to miss my chance, and I’m only getting one shot.

Godspeed, OP. I’ll tell your wife how you’ve touched so many with the pictorial story of your love when I see her on the next level. I imagine her peacefully and joyfully waiting for you, right by the gate.

Namaste"

154,"I saw your pictures around Christmas and I've seen your one from today. There are people around the world truly moved by your story, people around the world who will go out of their way to hold their loved ones a little tighter or say ""I love you"" that one more time than they would have done. Your love story has inspired that, help spread that love around the world and in doing so, make the world that little bit better.

Life I can imagine is not going to be easy to recover, but you'll find a way I truly hope. But as someone else has said, thank you for sharing your story and thank you for spreading a message of love without constraint around the world, because I believe you have.

The chances are unlikely, but if you ever find yourself in a city called Norwich in Norfolk, England, send me a message, I'd happily buy you a drink and have a chat and thank you in person and listen to what you have to share.


Edit: you guys are awesome and exactly what I mean about spreading their love around the world.

Edit2: thank you all for making my evening, for showing the love and support we need to make the world a little bit better. I hope OP sees this and sees he has support all around the globe.
To any of you going through the same, similar or just need a bit of support, I hope this shows there are people out there, people who care and people who want to listen. You don't have to be alone.

Wherever you guys are, whatever you guys are doing reach out to someone if you can and let them know they are loved and also have a fantastic day or night and remember we are here and we care."
155,"I'm sorry for your loss but happy for whatever peace this brought you. 

In May of 2017 I did the same thing for my brother, and for myself. A 1,300 mile flight, followed by a 6 hour drive, followed by a 10 minute walk got his ashes to where they needed to be.

One of the best, most difficult things that I've ever done.

Peace."
156,"Your first post about her health issues was 108 days ago.  From the pictures you shared, she was an active healthy young woman who enjoyed life.  108 days later she is gone.  It is humbling how quickly your entire world can be completely changed.  Time is precious and we waste so much of it.  I’m sorry for your loss."
157,"This is an amazing tribute to what looks like a wonderful marriage. My wife was diagnosed with cancer about 18 months ago. She was 35 at the time and we had been married for 10 years, now almost 12. We have 4 small children and not a day goes by that I don't think about the very real possibility of losing her in the coming years. It completely changes the way you look at everything. Thank you for sharing your experiences publicly, for some reason I find it comforting to see others go through these horrible experiences, it somehow makes my own experience feel more bearable."
158," 

Yes, I’m the same person from the Christmas tree photo and the highly controversial/misconstrued hospice photo.

I don’t care about karma, I care that people know she existed. She was an amazing woman that I’m proud to have called my wife. We were married for 5 years, together for 7. Our journey in photos: [Our Life](https://imgur.com/a/6SBgdIe)"
159,"Oh my dear, this is such a strong picture."
160,"I've just looked through your post history, Jesus man, thst was an emotional journey I wasn't prepared for. 

I wish you all the best OP. I don't really know what else to say to you at the moment, you're both so young and my heart breaks for you both and that potential snuffed out.

Something I always think of is a quote from Sheltering Skies by Paul Bowles

""Because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four, five times more, perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps 20. And yet it all seems limitless.""

Take care OP. X"
161,"I lost my ex in a mass shooting june 8, 2017. It was the darkest time I’ve ever been through. Not only did I lose the only I ever loved, but we didn’t have the finality of a “funeral”, we never saw any of the victims. They were all cremated. I think the worst part is, the shooter had posted every part of his plan months in advance. No one reported it and we thought he was a friend. Never leave angry. Our last words were an argument."
162,"I know she was here.
I know she was loved.
I know she is gone.

Nothing will replace her.
Nothing should replace her.
Nothing can replace her.

She was your gift in this world.
You were hers.

164,I saw this post and instantly knew it was the OP I found expressing his concerns and announcing the waiting game for your wife in the r/bloodclots subreddit. I want you to know a few days ago I remembered your posts and hunt it down. Cried a lil. You and your wife stuck with me.
165,I’m so sorry for your loss. Your tribute to you wife is truly beautiful.
166,"Just had a gander through your post history. Me and my wife are 28 and i cannot imagine facing what you have went through at 25. Shes in the bath and after looking at your posts ive came through to the bathroom to just sit and be with her. Your an incredibly strong person and i admire that. 
Shes proud man.

Edit: your also very good with a camera."
167,"I'm pretty sure this will get buried, but I really don't care. I have to put this in words. 
OP. First and foremost, my dearest condolences. I'm sitting at my desk at work in tears. I was having a bad day and I thought I'd take a scroll through Reddit when I saw your post. When I realized what I was looking at and read some of the comments, I went back and read your posts. 

The love that you have for your wife, and the love she has for you was palpable. I don't know you guys, but I can see the joy shining in your eyes in some of the photos you posted. I am angry on your behalf that you didn't get more time with your beautiful wife. It was a pleasure being able to see just how much you love each other. I hope that you find the healing you're craving. I hope you smile. I wish you nothing but luck, happiness and health going forward. Sending all my love from my very small corner of the world to you and your family. Thank you for sharing your story. Your wife is immortalized in the memories and thoughts of millions."

169,"I’m stunned at some of the awful comments here. Dude just lost the love of his life. He clearly states that he wants to celebrate her life by letting everyone know about her only for some awful keyboard trolls accusing him of karma farming, attention-seeking and telling him that something is wrong with him. I fucking dare each and every one of you to step away from your keyboard, find this guy and say it to his face. But you won’t. Because you know it’s a shitty thing to say. But you’re safe from any consequences behind the safety blanket of anonymity. Fuck each and every one of you. Heartless swine."

"" Do not stand at my grave and weep

I am not there. I do not sleep.

I am a thousand winds that blow.

I am the diamond glints on snow.

I am the sunlight on ripened grain.

I am the gentle autumn rain.

I am the swift uplifting rush

Of quiet birds in circled flight.

I am the soft stars that shine at night.

Do not stand at my grave and cry;

I am not there. I did not die.

My children and I have yet to fully accept it and move on with healthy lives. We have her ashes which she wants spread in Florida and Jerusalem.

I’ve been married going on forty-five years and this is something we’ve each been facing since the early eighties in one form or another.

180,Live in an Atlanta suburb. My wife works in one of the counties (works with kids) that opened for inperson classes so curious if anyone is able to say which school/school district this pic is from?
181,264 school district employees have already been quarantined for testing positive and/or exposed.
182,I appreciate that a few of those kids are wearing masks despite their peers all forgoing them. It’s gotta be hard to go against the grain like that
183,"In Miami we are opening for virtual only and will reassess every month to determine if infection rates have decreased to a low enough level for a staggered in person reopening with mandatory masks and limited student movement in the hallways. In addition to that, over 50% of parents have opted to do virtual instruction for the full school year. And even with that we are afraid to return to teaching in our classrooms."
184,"> “I think masks shouldn’t be mandatory,” said Gary Gunter, whose granddaughter attends Jefferson Elementary School. “The science has already proven that children are not spreaders. I have to trust the science.”

190,"And you know whats sick, the teachers being forced to work or lose their jobs.  Id like to think if I saw this Id walk right the fuck out of the building and tell the district that they can fire me, but theyll be hearing from my lawyers about unsafe working conditions.

Edit: Unreal the amount of bullshit comments here saying ""teachers are essential workers"" or ""what about other public employees, why are teachers so special?"".  This is a picture of a SCHOOL, its not a hospital, its not a meat packing plant, teachers and other school employees are the subject of discussion thats relevant to this picture.  Honestly, you guys can take your whataboutism arguements and shove it.  These people trained and got licensed to teach children, not become frontline pandemic babysitters for 40k a year and a 2-5% chance of death."
191,I see about 100 kids in this picture and only about 6 masks . They’re fucked .
192,I bet those kids that actually are wearing masks got bullied for it.
193,"I’m a teacher in Oregon. They finally pulled the trigger and said “distance learning for all” in the fall. This is why I’m *so* grateful for that decision. Kids might get a little worse education, or miss a year of socializing, but you know what? At least they will probably survive. I can help a kid catch up if they have a tough year online.

201,nice job Georgia. So many children will lose their parents....how dare you
202,I'm surprised that so many students don't wear masks. Even more so than the fact that schools got re-opened. I always thought at least young people had some sense left but wow. This is disheartening.
203,"First of all, that school shouldn't be open. That's not even up for debate. But even if you're stupid enough to do *that*, no one should get in without a mask. HOW FUCKING HARD IS THAT???"
204,"Fucking Georgia. 


So many idiots are in charge and we have no one to blame but ourselves. 

These kids have NO control over this, that’s what sucks."

[The death toll from the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre was at least 10,000 people, killed by a Chinese army unit whose troops were likened to “primitives”, a secret British diplomatic cable alleged.  The newly declassified document, written little more than 24 hours after the massacre, gives a much higher death toll than the most commonly used estimates which only go up to about 3,000.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tiananmen-square-massacre-death-toll-secret-cable-british-ambassador-1989-alan-donald-a8126461.html)

[In 2014, however, it was reported that a confidential US government file quoted a Chinese military source as saying the Communist regime’s own internal assessment believed 10,454 people had been killed – a figure that would fit Sir Alan’s initial estimate.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tiananmen-square-massacre-death-toll-secret-cable-british-ambassador-1989-alan-donald-a8126461.html)

I’m in the US and I know I feel helpless seeing what’s happening and want to help in any way I can in some direct way.

War is hell and I hate that the leaders who perpetuate it don’t care about the human cost of it. My father was born a month before the end of the Korean War (side note- fuck Stalin for basically creating North Korea), in a city his family fled to in order to escape the fighting near Seoul. Not everyone was so lucky to make it out in time safely and millions of people were separated from their families (to this day), killed or displaced. The spectre of war still haunts Korea and the Korean people, not only because the war never actually ended.

Fuck Putin and fuck the power structures that allowed him to get to this point."

>(2/7) Our papers used three independent imaging software libraries (including one developed by my friend @sparse_k).  While I wrote much of the code for one of these pipelines, Katie was a huge contributor to the software; it would have never worked without her contributions and

>(3/7) the work of many  others who wrote code, debugged, and figured out how to use the code on challenging EHT data.

Katie Bouman? Only wrote 2.4k lines of code

http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-haystack-first-image-black-hole-0410

Looks like MIT's social media twitter account didn't collaborate with MIT's own news office since in reality, Katie Bouman did not lead any team at all or was a leader at all.

The actual leaders were Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael.

Notice how before this social media shilling on twitter, the MIT article only mentioned Katie Bouman once at the very end of the article.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-haystack-first-image-black-hole-0410

>The Haystack EHT team includes John Barrett, Roger Cappallo, Joseph Crowley, Mark Derome, Kevin Dudevoir, Michael Hecht, Lynn Matthews, Kotaro Moriyama, Michael Poirier, Alan Rogers, Chester Ruszczyk, Jason SooHoo, Don Sousa, Michael Titus, and Alan Whitney. Additional contributors were MIT alumni Daniel Palumbo, Katie Bouman, Lindy Blackburn, Sera Markoff, and Bill Freeman, a professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

How long before this MIT article written by MIT themselves gets taken down and rewritten to give Katie Bouman a whole paragraph to herself?

When will the mainstream media take responsibility for inaccurate reporting? Why is there such a glaring difference between one of MIT's twitter accounts versus their own press release?

Why were the 2 leaders: Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael completely ignored by everybody else?

4 teams around the world.

American team was ked by Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael.

Nowhere it is mentioned that Katie Bouman led the American team, just only these 2 males who were co leaders.

Where did this Katie Bouman was leader originate from? Even MIT's own news article doesn't mention this.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-haystack-first-image-black-hole-0410"
471,"Tuns out she did a sub, sub, sub part of a program. A sort of 'adaptor' that just reformats certain data into another format, and then feeds it into the ACTUAL program.

That misrepresentation of what she actually contributed and what she actually did is nauseating. Either nepotism on the part of the institution or the media.

Sources:

Here is what she wrote (hopstools): https://github.com/klbouman/hopstools

Here the mother program where that optional part of her is added, where it acts as a sort of interface to import one more datatype by reformatting it.

Source: https://github.com/sao-eht/eat/graphs/contributors

It's kinda ridiculous how the media morphs this into something COMPLETELY different.

Btw, that's also NOT an algorithm, but just reformatting data.

---

You don't understand, she did NOT write and algorithm at all. She did NOT write an image tool at all.

What she did code is at max about 4 pages of code, but more importantly, that's neither an algorithm nor a imaging program, but an ADAPTOR for a source of data which reformats the data to feed it into the mother program of which she contributed that adaptor, which makes up 0.01% of said mother program at max AND is marked as ""optional"" part of the program.

Source: https://github.com/sao-eht/eat/graphs/contributors

---

Her whole bundle (hopstools) here was merged into the mother program and counted as one commit of 'mother' program. hopstools, of which she did at max 25%, so her share on contribution on this actual imaging program is about 0.3% max, but OK, lets say 1%, so she did less than 1/4 of 1% of the work. Max. If we're very generous.

This little part is the share that her contribution does. And again, hopstools is just an adaptor for another data 
format that can be read into the 'mother' program. That's it.

Andrew Chael wrote 850k out of the 900k lines of code (a lot of it is auto generated lines, but he contributed a large chunk of it). He was also the leader of the project. Michael D. Johnson wrote 12k lines of code. Chanchikwan wrote 5k lines of code.

The woman? Only wrote 2.4k lines of code.

Interestingly enough, the code she wrote was importing something called HOPStools.

Interestingly enough, if we go look at HOPStools and all its contributors, we get:

Weilgusm wrote 2.9k lines of code.

Chanchikwan wrote 676 lines of code.

Andrew Chael wrote 1.2k lines of code.

Jpbarrett wrote 71 lines of code.

Katie Bouman wrote 2 lines of code.

Hell, even on the hopstools thing, there is this in the summary:

For Katie:

cd /Users/klbouman/Research/vlbi_imaging/software/hops/build source hops.bash

run this file from: /Users/klbouman/Research/vlbi_imaging/software/hops/eat""

She also fixed absolutely none of the bugs on the EHT.

And the algorithm they talk about? It was plagiarized off of a Japanese guy named Mareki Honma who made the thing back in 2012, and uploaded/updated it to GitHub in 2016.

Andrew Chael asked to use it, Honma helped him adapt it, and was part of 60 Japanese people working on the project.

Katie Bouman also isn't following anyone at all on GitHub, and has basically only utilized it for these two projects: hopstools and EHT.

---

The second co-leader of the EHT imaging group is Kazunori Akiyama, with the first being Andrew Chael.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-haystack-first-image-black-hole-0410

>The Haystack EHT team includes John Barrett, Roger Cappallo, Joseph Crowley, Mark Derome, Kevin Dudevoir, Michael Hecht, Lynn Matthews, Kotaro Moriyama, Michael Poirier, Alan Rogers, Chester Ruszczyk, Jason SooHoo, Don Sousa, Michael Titus, and Alan Whitney. Additional contributors were MIT alumni Daniel Palumbo, Katie Bouman, Lindy Blackburn, Sera Markoff, and Bill Freeman, a professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

How long before this MIT article written by MIT themselves gets taken down and rewritten to give Katie Bouman a whole paragraph to herself?

When will the mainstream media take responsibility for inaccurate reporting? Why is there such a glaring difference between one of MIT's Twitter accounts versus their own press release?

Why were the 2 leaders, Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael, completely ignored by everybody else?

4 teams around the world.

American team was led by Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael.

Nowhere it is mentioned that Katie Bouman led the American team, just only these 2 males who were co-leaders.

Where did this ""Katie Bouman was a leader"" originate from? Even MIT's own news article doesn't mention this.

Katie Bouman did not invent the algorithm.

Multiple people are cited on the limited proof of concept thesis.

The actual research and development of practical application of this technology, as well as development of the algorithm itself, was done by a huge team of researchers, not Katie Bouman:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06226

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06226.pdf

https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205

This is the primary research that led to the possibility of imaging the black hole. Notice how the research cites Andrew Chael’s EHT imaging library (the guy who wrote 850,000 lines of code). Chael wrote the entire library. To not give him the same or preferably more credit than Bouman is pretty messed up.

https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/people/andrew-chael

Also, Katie Bouman did not lead or manage anything. These are the directors, managers, and affiliates:

https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/our-people

Katie Bouman does not deserve 100%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, or even 1% of the credit. There are so many people involved that made far more significant contributions (like Andrew Chael developing the EHT imaging library).

What has science come to when such incredible falsehoods about who contributed to research are perpetuated by the scientific community and mainstream media? It’s wrong.

Credit for this sleuthing goes to u/Dorkydor. I just fixed grammar.

>The rover has been silent since June when a planet-wide dust storm prevented sunlight from reaching its solar panels; lacking energy, Opportunity could not stay awake. The hope was that the rover would revive when the skies cleared, but it has not responded after months of efforts to contact it.

>On Tuesday night, NASA made one last call to Opportunity. On Wednesday, the space agency is expected to announce that it is wrapping up the mission.

The first Martian colony is surrounded by the Martian creatures. They close in on the unarmed astronauts, they've never tasted human blood, their mandibles are erect in anticipation. The astronauts hug one another, knowing this is the end. They look to the sky, hoping in vain to see a glimpse of the pale blue dot, the home they'll never see again. It's no use, the dust is too thick. Like many pioneers to this hellish world before them, they will perish under a red storm. They close their eyes and wait for death.

When suddenly a blast is heard, a scream, and then another and another. They open their eyes. A cloaked figure has appeared out of nowhere, and is raining fire down on the creatures from above. They flee, back to the cracks in the Martian soil they crawled from, mandibles tucked between their six legs.

""But...who?"" The commander asks

The cloaked figure turns slowly with an odd whirring sound and lowers its hood.

""Impossible!"" The wide-eyed commander declares, ""You were lost over a hundred years ago! They said you were dead!""


""Not quite, commander. Opportunity always knocks when you least expect it.""

As many of you have pointed out, this image breaks the first rule of the subreddit, given that it is very obviously a screenshot. While that would normally merit a removal, we've decided to make a slight exception in this case. Our reasoning is as follows:

1. The image is an aspect of a particularly impactful and important story.
2. The digital elements included in the screenshot are small and unobtrusive enough to *almost* fall under the watermark-specific caveat outlined in Rule 1B.

Furthermore, while the atrocities being committed are very disturbing, remember that encouraging or inciting violence – whether implicitly or explicitly – is directly against Reddit's site-wide rules... so while we may be justifiably outraged about what's taking place, please refrain from offering comments suggesting (for example) that Winnie the Pooh needs to be separated from his stuffing.

607,"The picture is from [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CedVnJOgwg4) by FOX 11 L.A.

China is currently still imprisoning political and religious prisoners in internment camps and reeducation camps. China has also been accused of harvesting organs from these prisoners.

In all likelihood, the person who took this image did so under the danger of imprisonment or death if discovered.

edit: since people keep asking how they can oppose the Chinese government and their brutal methods against Falun Gong and Uyghurs as well as their ""invasions"" of Hong Kong and Taiwan in a meaningful way, I suggest [this page by the International Uyghur Human Rights and Democracy Foundation](http://www.iuhrdf.org/help), and [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cv0ws4/how_can_you_help_hong_kong_protests_from_abroad/) in /r/HongKong.

608,"It still blows my mind that basically we have Nazi Germany existing again with all its horrors, and yet because China is so involved in the world economy and so many companies (who pay off politicians) are so invested in the region that it is just being ignored. 

Imagine if Hitler was just killing off all jews in Europe and the US and UK was just letting it happen because Nazi Germany made them money. At the moment, Xi Jinping is basically Hitler reborn for the modern times and China's government is the Third Reich, and China's people are the brainwashed, ignorant, or willing participants, just like Germany's population."
609,What can a normal person do besides boycotting Chinese products and writing to MPs?
610,There's money to be made so the world turns a blind eye. Watching the world burn is fucking depressing.
611,"""Never again\*""

\* ^(unless it is country that is an economic superpower and confronting them would start another world war... cus then I guess they can keep it going if they're quiet about about it)"
612,"Ever wondered how it was possible that Nazi Germany did what they did?

Ever wondered what it looks like when unwanted people are being murdered efficiently and on an industrious scale?

Ever wondered how Nazi Germany employed 1/3rd of its population to spy on the rest?

Ever wondered why the world did nothing to stop it for so long?

You are now watching Nazi Germany v2.0. It's here, right in front of you. Bigger, better and more powerful. And all the businesses in the world want to do business with Nazi Germany v2.0.

This is what it feels like when not enough people care."
613,"I am German. We talk about WW2 and the Holocaust a lot, like seriously. A lot. I’ve had my fair share of pictures of mangled, beaten, starved innocent people. But they were all from the past. It’s what we want to learn from to never do that again. And yet, in this day and age we get pictures like these. On days like these i am ashamed to be breathing the same air as the people that commit these atrocities"
614,"This makes me so angry, yet as just an average guy with very little money and living in the midwestern U.S. I feel so completely helpless!

What can I do? I want to help."

628,"needs more upvotes, i knew things were bad in china but i made the mistake of thinking they were at least feeding their prisoners. Future generations will look as these times and ask ""what did you do about china"" just like we ask our old people what they did when germany was executing people. 

&#x200B;

**FUCK CHINA**"
629,Fuck genocide. Fuck dictatorship. And fuck anyone who would allow either to ever happen. This is what happens when you give one man too much power.
630,Its so creepy how Ghislane photobombs all these pictures. Like a pervert watermark.
631,She is like the Where's Waldo of pedos.
632,"How convenient that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell took photos of all the rich and powerful people they invited to their pedo sex island. That would come in really handy if they were to blackmail powerful people for money or power. It's almost like they set ut up.

For example, they would eventually be caught because of the pedo-thing. And once caught, imagine having all these photos, blackmailing all these rich and powerful people to pull strings to avoid jail time. ""Hey mr x, if I go down, they will find all the photos in the vault on my island."". Either the blackmail works, or you get suicided and they send a large team of cleaners to the island."
633,Never happened. PRINCE ANDREW DOESN’T SWEAT.
634,There are witnesses on-record in the Netflix Epstein doc that describe him as visiting the island on numerous occasions and grinding/fondling underage topless girls. The media should have talked about that more.
635,"""Ghislaine did not kill herself."" Sorry just practicing."
636,Her interview in the Epstein miniseries was heart-wrenching
637,"Do not overly focus on this one single pervert, there are **many** of other powerful people mixed up in the periphery of this story. With the recent arrest of Maxwell, it is likely that we will learn some additional information, but rest assured that there are very powerful people - from bankers to royalty - around the world that are extremely interested in keeping this under wraps and out of the public eye.

*Edit: Epstein did not kill himself*"
638,The fact these idiots pose for photos like this is mind boggling
639,*Shaggy - It Wasn’t Me .. intensifies
640,Man it's wild to me how many pictures Ghislaine is just creepin' in

643,"Disgusting, despicable monsters, why isn't he in prison already?

&#x200B;

It really proves that rich people are above the law, no matter how disgusting and despicable they are, they are shielded by their money and position!"
644,"After watching the NetFlix docuseries on Esptein and his group, it was one of the few times in my life that I was absolutely discusted with something and how this shit was allowed to go on for so long. Just so many prominent individuals just looking the other way and helping hide Epstein's group activity of trafficking kids.

If anyone is taken down I personally think it'll be Prince Andrew first. Andrew seems like he is going to be the ~~sacrifice~~ first sacrifice of the elites. That's just my opinion."
645,[deleted]
646,Lying ass rich people
647,I don’t remember this at all or who that woman is. Excuse me sir that’s not how photos work. How could he just lie straight faced to that interviewer. My mouth was on the floor when I saw it.
648,"This picture always unnerves me.

If you didn't know the context you would just assume it's a picture of an inncocent, harmless memory of a social gathering. No different to pictures we see of our parents before we were born.

Every time I see it, I wonder what each person was thinking at the time of this photo being taken. All have the same practiced smile each of us emit when the camera pops out. But the story is so much worse than what the camera shows."
649,I want a guillotine emoji
650,"It's really weird how pretty much everyone knows there's a huge global elite pedo scandal, they even murdered the guy who was days away from exposing it.

Yet, nothing is done about it and seemingly no one cares. These dudes were at a literal island fucking kids and teenagers."
651,I’ve never seen someone in the background of so many photos as Ghislaine Maxwell
652,She was my neighbor when I lived in Loxahatchee which is in west palm. Her dad was a weird dude and you could tell she was troubled. She was always very forward with her flirting now it all makes sense. Her dad would brag about going to the breakers and mar a lago because she had the “in” there.
653,"In his defence, how is one suppose to remember all the underage girls they rape? I’m sure the prince has raped hundreds. Cut him some slack on the names."
654,The fact I have to pay money so this slime can live in luxury is disgusting.
655,Well he's royally fucked
656,"If you’ve ever wanted to see someone who’s massively confused over being challenged for something for the first time in their pampered life after years of getting every little thing they want, starting to realise that people who aren’t unbearably rich aren’t actually dribbling idiots and assuming saying things like ""I forgot"" and offering up wooden looks of shock and horror when it’s suggested that they’ve done something ‘bad‘, watch his BBC interview. It’s fucking hilarious."
657,By an odd coincidence both Ms Giuffre and her Dad were both employed to work at Mar a Lago.
658,"I worked as a child social worker for a very short while. Paedophilia among the rich, preying on young girls and boys, prepubescent, is totally widespread. I left because i tried to do something about it and was forced out. It seems to be the dark underside of the rich preying on the poor. Often the men while their wives preen about displaying their wealth and in total denial. I come from a wealthy background and i always felt there were lies which is why i tried this work. It is also why i survived, because any attempt at whistle blowing in this world leads to violent repercussions. I am now the poor outcast of my family, but a lot happier. It's generation after generation. But social media is making it harder to supress. I am so glad. Gotta catch them all."
659,The media's heavy insistence on pushing the Prince Andrew element of this story is 100% driven by their need to bury the Donald Trump element of this story.
660,"Do we seriously have to go through this again, people?

Okay, fine... but I'm *very* disappointed in you.

**This is not an advertisement. ""Crocs Gloves"" is not a real product. Ketchup is not a vegetable. A single hyphen is the difference between a ""man-eating chicken"" and a ""man eating chicken."" A vocative comma is the difference between ""Come on, people!"" and ""Come on people!""**

In short, stop reporting the post. Nobody is trying to sell you anything."

669,"Can't say I'm surprised or really upset at all due to the fact of how much they blew up over the past two weeks, I figured they were going to get in touch one way or another.  I talked about it a bit more, Fair Use in parody, and being a content creator in general on [YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQQHHRwPF0I&t=2s) Now onto the next unnecessary invention!"
670,The is the Crocs legal department going through the motions of protecting the company's trademark. They basically have to send this guy a C&D.
671,I hope you got that letter framed and hung up on the wall. Very few receive the honour of getting a “stop your shit before we sue you” letter from crocs!

675,Make a Croc Chastity Belt to annoy them further. I mean normal Crocs are technically a Chastity Belt anyway as nobody is going to get laid wearing Crocs. However it would still be really funny to see a second cease and desist!
676,"I got a letter one time asking me to please stop calling velcro “velcro.”  Sorry that your brand name has become a noun, but no way I’m calling it “interlocking fastening tape.”

681,As long as your not selling them I really don’t think they can do anything about it.

694,Would had been better if they had posed with a Whopper and Burger King fries.
695,"IDK who OP is, but the guy that did this is one of my really good friends! He made a video about it if you want to learn more about how he did it. [Link](https://youtu.be/0rJHC6nY4F8)  :)

Also, [link to original Twitter post](https://twitter.com/jevholution/status/1036415320959930368?s=21).

Edit: No, they were not hired by McDonald’s for this. This is not a marketing campaign. Just a fun, weirdly extravagant prank. 

If you knew him, this is completely in vein of everything he does in life. Right down to the extreme attention to detail and “extra-ness.”

No, he didn’t drill holes into the wall (it’s command tape, so it’s not permanent and won’t be considered vandalism).

Yes, it’s still really hanging up at our local McDonald’s.

He’s an aspiring filmmaker and studies media production which is why he’s so good at design hahaha."
696,Or.... Is this just a sneaky ad for Mcdonalds masking as a cool reddit post! I'm going to think this over with a McDouble and McFlurry.  
697,"My guess is this is typical ""I thought another manager did this"" type thing.  Promotions and advertisements get changed frequently enough ."
698,"One of the mcdonalds in my town stretched a jpeg image of a fruit shake into a 8'x12' poster and each pixel is bigger than a quarter. It's glorious.

The best part? Some old person with 0 multimedia experience is holding that position down while there are recent grads looking for work that *actually know not to stretch a fucking jpeg to use on a physical advert* but somehow remain ""unqualified""."
699,"I mean shit, McDonalds should be giving them a job. That's very well done."
700,Are the dotted circles re-spawning locations for fries?
701,If I was that store manager I'd leave it up too. Looks professional af.
702,I bet that manager couldn’t give two shits.
703,"*Hey Steve those kids are hanging a poster of themselves eating our product on the wall over there. As the manager I think you should do something about this very important matter. Steve? Why aren’t you doing anything? Steve? Oh my god they’re getting away Steve! Why don’t you care about this more - it’ll be up there for months unless you do something about it Steve. It’s almost like you don’t even care about this incredible job we have. I’m calling the FBI if you don’t do something about this Steve.*


"
704,"The manager probably knows it's not suppose to be there but it's so well done they probably said ""fuck it. It's nicely done and goes with the store so let's keep it."""
705,"Definitely the circles that did it. Random enough to be design, but not too much. "
706,r/madlads
707,They carried a massive picture into McDonald’s and hung it by drilling holes in a wall without anyone noticing?
708,To be fair it looks like something that would be up 
709,"It's actually always been on my bucket list to do this at a hard rock cafe. Take a fancy black and white picture of yourself wearing a fur jacket or something, your face can even be  half covered or out of focus. Sign it with a black sharpie, frame it, sneak it into the restaurant in a purse or whatever. Then slyly find a blank space to hang it up (maybe just with some 3M sticky strips?) and hope that no one notices for a while. Keep going back to that restaurant once or twice a year to check on your fame"
710,may they end up in ellen
711,If I was the manager there and I saw that someone had done that and had done it that well I wouldn’t take it down either. 
712,This is a wholesome prank. What pranks were meant to be.
713,Looks professional. Fits the message. And fills the needs of a blank wall beautifully. Why would they take it down. 
714,We believe it 
715,"My buddy Greg and I tried the same thing at Victoria's Secret. 

They apparently noticed two 38-year-old men with ""dad bods"" in lingerie was not ""corporate approved"" marketing. We were also banned from the mall, but I still feel like an angel. "
716,"We did this in a GM office/factory in Ohio in the 80s.  At my residence we had this ugly velvet picture thing like they used to sell at roadside fleamarkets and the like.  We got this idea to post it on the wall for a lark.  We used simple masking tape on the back.  Me, being young and such just walked in the front door, down the wide hallway, and planted it on the wall so that it would be in plain view of all that entered.  It stayed up for 2-3 weeks, then must've fallen from weight.  One time we arrived at work to see two executives leaning on the wall, one on each side of the picture, discussing something.  Good times."
717,That poster is dead on point!!!  Not too surprising nobody's noticed...

Edit: I’ll keep the list going: rampant nepotism, breaking our word to our allies, abandoning the Kurds, abandoning the Paris treaty and Iran treaty, giving validation to Kim Jon Un (and guess what, nuclear proliferation in North Korea continues), asking a foreign power to investigate an American political candidate, letting Russia do whatever they want (both in real life and over the internet), inciting race riots, calling Neo-Nazis fine people, war crimes at the border, having immigrant women’s uteri removed, Muslim travel ban, paying less Taxes than the average college student, making lying a cornerstone of the White House, mocking the disabled, nominating a sexual predator to scotus, super-spreading Covid in the Rose Garden, not wearing a mask till July 2020 cause his ego hence inciting anti-maskers, funneling money to his resorts through the secret service and government events, trying to buy Greenland and thus completely obliterating the respect we had abroad, leaving the State Department a shell of itself, selling off to the highest bidder our national treasure and natural resources, inciting police violence, deeply sowing doubt in the safety of US elections, attacking Goodyear and Nordstrom rack (the latter cause Ivanka’s low-selling line was dropped), blowing up the deficit with tax cuts for the rich, insulting McCain and plenty more veterans, pulling out of the WHO, cutting the pandemic preparedness team, passing on millions of extra vaccine doses, sharing state secrets in non-confidential settings, removed protection status from 59,000 Haitiana forcing them to return to disaster-ridden Haiti by July 2019, caused the longest government shutdown in US history, gassed protestors to take a Bible photo OP, and overall showing the worst of our country to our children."

816,"When I was in the eighth grade my band teacher called my mom and told her that I was talented, and that if I wanted to continue to play, my current instrument would hold me back. At the time, I played my dad's trumpet, and it was 30 years old. That Christmas/birthday/the next Christmas my gift was my trumpet. I had to agree to play all the way through high school, and it was difficult for my parents to afford it- I believe it cost about $700-800. It cost enough that we timed the purchase for the same time we were going to a neighboring state that had no sales tax just to save the hundred bucks. I still remember the rain in the parking lot as I walked to the car, clutching the blue case to my chest. It was the most expensive thing I owned, or would own for a long time.

Band got me up in the morning, it made it so I went to school even when other kids sucked. It gave me something to work for, it gave me camaraderie and made me depend on others as others depended on me. It gave me pride, and showed me the correlation between hard work and reward. It kept me in college when I may have otherwise chickened out, given up and gone home. There is no rush like running onto a field with 30k people screaming in the stands, and music was the only thing that would ever give me that feeling.

I'm 33 now, and I don't play that much anymore- but that trumpet, a music stand and a book of exercises still sits next to my desk. I hope to allow my son to play it someday. The trumpet, band, music in general changed my life, it made me a better person and it made me who I am today. I'm getting choked up writing this, so I'll just say, this gift is powerful for someone like me, and something small really can change lives."
817,Holy shit I got my trumpet from them too!  Hello fellow Casselberrian!
818,you still play it? professionally??
819,"To the angry people on this thread - it went from ""what a kind act"" to ""OP should give the trumpet back because he's not a professional trumpet player"" really fast. 

I just checked out OP's profile and the guy is 21 years old. If trumpets are as expensive as y'all say - I sure as hell could NOT afford to ""pay it forward"" by buying a brand new one for anyone at age 21.

It took me literally 30 seconds to click on a post he wrote mentioning his age - giving me context I needed before I judged him. Maybe y'all need to take a second and step back from being keyboard warriors and look for a little information before deciding what kind of person someone is. 

First ever reddit gold- thank you kind stranger. :) I'm glad it was this comment that earned me a gold. "
820,"I have played and collected trumpets all my life. I currently have 9 of them that are in great working condition. Most of them I acquired at yard sales for less than $40 USD.

Seeing that this company is still in business, I have contacted them and asked how I might donate all 9 of my horns for the specific purpose of having them placed into the hands of students who want to learn, but who cannot afford their own.

While I do not know the status of James W. Jones, it is my hope that this spirit of paying forward remains a foundational core with Allegro Music Company.

Thank you OP for sharing, and for reminding me that a garage full of instruments that nobody plays is just a waste.

And who knows - maybe we can get more redditors to do the same. Maybe we can so inundate this company with old horns long neglected, that we might start something really great."
821,"I'm kind of curious why this post has the **US Politcs** flair. I assume because it has the word trumpet in the title, but even that seems pretty damn ridiculous."

823,"Very cool. I like to do something similar. I've been playing guitar for decades and have more instruments than I need. Whenever I hear a friend / coworker say ""I've always wanted to play guitar..."" I say ""here you go"" and let them have one. ""Give it back when you don't play it anymore and lessons are free"". 

I think at this point my conversion rate is 100% with most people buying their own instrument within a year!

Edit: gold? Thank you internet stranger !"
824,"This may get buried... but I was recently going through some old stuff from when I was a little kid. I found a homemade birthday card from my mom (single mom, only child). It was like old school early 90s clipart she made for me on the computer. On the inside it looked like a certificate. She colored the whole thing in with crayons. It probably took her a long time to make in those early days of computer art. The certificate said it was good for ""$20 at Toys R Us this Saturday.""

When I found this, my mom explained to me that my birthday fell just before that month's pay day that year and she did not have any money to buy me a present... so she made me the card and we went to Toys R Us after her pay day and I had no idea anything was amiss.

830,"I grew up in 'the ghetto.'  My elementary school looked more like a prison than a school. 

In the 4th grade, the city gave the schools a pittance to start music programs to try and reinvigorate learning. Each student had to pick an instrument to play for a semester and I chose violin.

I honestly don't know how much it was to rent the instrument- the first semester was free because it was part of the required curriculum, but after that if we wanted to continue we had to pay. But I found out after a few months through a slip made by my conductor that he was covering the rental for mine, as well as other students.

I played for 3 years at that school, until I went to junior high. That school didn't have a music program and my mom definitely couldn't afford private lessons, so I fell out of playing. But I'll always remember the generosity of our conductor and how he inspired children to listen to, learn, and love classical music.
"
831,"When I was in sixth grade I was in band and I had chosen to play the clarinet which just happened to be the instrument my teacher used as well. A few months into school my teacher set up an after school program for the band kids who wanted extra practice. It had to be paid for, though, but it wasn't much. It was, however, too much for my mother to afford at the time (times were tough back then and they still are on occasion). My teacher knew I enjoyed playing, though, so he offered to pay for me and I  got go to the program!

834,"This made me cry. My mom was a single mother of two and struggled HARD. But my brother and I never truly knew how hard, she always made sure we had everything we needed and always put us first.

She took a part time job at a daycare that she would do in the mornings before going to her waitress job, so my brother could go there and she got a discount. Her car broke down once, and she was in no place to get it fixed, but was fucked without a car. My grandma lived in a different state at the time, we had no other family to help, and without a car, she couldn't get to work. The director of the daycare let her borrow the daycare van for a week while she saved up to fix her car. I remember her crying on the way home and thought what's she crying for? She can use the van!

Ms. Gail was a godsend. She was the director of the daycare and had been in an abusive marriage, and when it ended, she was left with almost nothing and two boys to raise. I found out many years later that she was the neighbor of my best friends parents, and my bffs dad helped her with yard work and such a lot. She was a super nice woman, and eventually met and married a wonderful man, who happened to be a very well off surgeon. She got to put her boys through college, retire early, and go on beach vacations with her husband all the time. If anyone deserved it, it was her. My best friend had to move back home with her folks after a bad marriage and was struggling hard to raise her son. She had a ton of student loan debt, but worked really hard and was making a dent in it. Ms. Gail found out about her situation, and sent her a check for $500 to put towards her loans, so she could afford to start saving up for her own place. That woman helped my mom out so many times. I'm so glad she got a happy ending."

Every Thursday morning we have a little meeting and pick up our checks, it's optional, and he brings all of us bagel sandwiches from the deli down the street. I've never seen him raise his voice to anyone.

I have heard it all before, ""We've got your back"", ""we're a team"", ""we're all in this together"", ""if you screw up just tell us so we can fix it""... 

Well I got the same spiel from the owners wife when I started this job and I didn't believe it. I broke a $1200 filter my second week and it was treated as a learning experience and not a lecture about how bad I suck.

I always give my all when I'm at work because it's just how I am, I can't feel okay with myself if I half-ass. The pool industry where I'm at is weird, the owners try to pick off the good workers of other companies since we all bump into one another at the supply store. 

I have finally started receiving these offers and there would need to be daily blowjob's and a very very large salary for me to leave the job I'm at. The work is hard and I'm tired a lot but I've never been treated this well before and it impacts my life more than I ever would've imagined it could.

843,"This is the same sort of spineless bullshit you see from management in the corporate world, too. 

At my last job, my manager quit without notice. Just couldn’t take it anymore. 

As I had the most experience in the department, I got brought in and offered the position. I took it because the bump in pay was attractive and I knew I could handle it. 

I did the job well for six months— during which time I spent 2 months in Mexico City getting our off-site data center setup. At my yearly review, I was given an exemplary score and told I had “saved the day.”

Three weeks later, my director brought me in and told me they’d hired a *new* department manager who had much more experience. I was told *several times* that I’d done an amazing job and that it had nothing to do with performance. 

I was flabbergasted and told my director that it felt like an act of betrayal. I’d busted my ass over that six months— spending 2 months away from my wife and 2 year-old daughter— just to be stabbed in the back and told it wasnt personal. 

He tried to argue that he’d informed me that the position was for “interim department manager.” I took out the official offer letter I’d received from HR and showed it to him. The word “interim” wasn’t anywhere on it. He just said *”Well, that was a mistake on our part. I apologize.”*

He then offered me a team lead position and I told him I’d need a few days to think about it. It would reduce my salary back down to what I was making before accepting the promotion. Oh, and he also asked me to be on a “steering committee” to get the new manager up to speed. 

I called up one of my old bosses and he offered me a position the following week. I quit without notice."

> We've spoken numerous times regarding a management position. When I expressed my interest in an AGM position, you told me those weren't available at the moment, but I was a great candidate for when one did become available. You also told me you wanted me in the Director of Sales position when Jessica left. Because I truly enjoyed my job, I never pushed the issue. I always figured you would tell me more when the time came. On August 13, you emailed me an attachment showing a new manager listed. When I asked you about it, you were cold and short. I asked you about it the next day and you told me ""This discussion is over, Milly You're being ridiculous."" Being HURT, is not being ridiculous, Brian. I have worked my tail off working doubles, coming in on my days off to do social, cleaning rooms, folding laundry, preparing breakfast, all while watching the Front Desk as well... Just for you to offer no explanation as to why a new manager was hired and I wasn't even considered? Then when I try having that conversation with you, BEING SHUT DOWN? I've thought long and hard about why that could possibly be. Perhaps because I don't wear my uniform? I was always taught to dress for the position I want. Not the one I have. Other than that, I'm stumped. I have gone the extra mile for this hotel and its guests. I have PERSONALLY received many amazing and 5 star reviews on Google. I have cross trained and LEARNED many different positions to keep this hotel afloat. I have put everything into this, and this is what I get in return?

Why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free?"" After having to cancel my flight in order to work due to being short staffed, a friend of mine told me ""They're just going to run you dry until they don't need you anymore"". Even in a time of need, you've still managed to make me feel unvalued in such a short amount of time. I have given a great effort and got a huge slap in the face. I no longer want given this a area or need this for my life. Truthfully, I've stayed because of the genuine bond I've formed with our guests and because I respected you, Brian.

854,"I used to work at a hotel and was in a similar position to Milly, working front desk primarily but also being able to do almost any other job in the hotel. Guests left 5 star reviews using my name and even brought me gifts and offered to buy me dinner on several occasions! I knew I was valuable, but the owners did not apparently. For the first few months, I worked 2nd shift by myself. No housekeepers, no managers, no other front desk staff. I was the only employee in the entire 80+ room hotel for 8 hours straight. I made $9 per hour. They finally put another front desk person on for part of that shift after I told them how insane it was. I worked there for 6 months.They offered me an interview for a management position after I quit, but I never went back.

Edit: I should add that during my shift there were times where I would barely actually be at the desk because I was so busy catering to guest needs, whether that meant taking things to their room or cleaning an entire room that was missed by housekeeping. That’s pretty much the only reason I could convince them to put another person on that shift, so it would be more convenient for the guests.

Edit 2: Yes it true I was like 19 or 20 at the time with no prior hotel experience, but all of the employees were underpaid, even those with experience. When I left, the GM asked me what I would be making at my new job. I didn’t want to tell him, so I said “more than I would make here in three years”. Eventually he talked it out of me, and when he found out my new job started at $12, he said “yeah you’re right.”"

I let her know that she would never get promoted because, well, she does manager-level work at the subordinate level. And that they'll keep dangling the carrot until they wring her dry. After a few weeks and right before a major work event that had the big wigs came through, my wife gave them a courtesy 5 days notice. Now since my wife handled a lot of work loads and single-handedly managed many passwords and other credentials, the managers were running around begging and pleading for her to stay and that they would promote her ""after"" the executives left. Nope, my wife wasn't falling for the ookey-doke. She quit and the managers were stressing out. Weeks later, a coworker she hung with said the executives left with a bad taste in their mouths as they were disappointed in how much information the managers didn't know or how they ran the business."

I started out as a cashier and ended knowing how to do every single job except for framing and a couple of manager side jobs. I knew the store inside and out and all I asked was AT LEAST 25 hours (I was in a cheap place at the time and did fine with less hours). They gave me 15 or less every week. At one point, I wasn't even doing the job I was hired to do. The kicker is that I transferred to the store because I moved practically across the state and finally got a place to live after being homeless for about 2 months.

I had a promotion and a management position dangled in front of me. My son was just born and I spent 80 hours working and weeding out deadwoods, launched product that chased after shiny objects. I met all the things they asked for by putting ridiculous hours for them. 

Around annual review time, it was suddenly announced that my colleague will be my manager and I also won't get a promotion because my previous manager had some random stuff he thought I could improve on (with no samples/path). 

When I left, people swept it under ""he wasn't happy he didn't get promoted"" reason. Fuck that."

880,"I understand looting and rioting is wrong, but the people who are solely focused on condemning that and totally ignoring this are part of the problem. The police brutality, abuse of power and corruption the whole world is currently witnessing for the past week should not be normal."
881,"There’s hundreds, probably thousands of videos showing the police macing, tear gassing, attacking, beating, and spraying rubber bullets at peaceful, non-violent protestors.  In addition to this instance here, there’s several videos of police destroying water and supplies. 

And yet, the Cop apologists still fail to see that they are actively going down in history as the people who blindly accepted the injustices in front of them during one of the biggest American civil rights movements of all time.

Edit : yes, it has been confirmed to be the biggest civil rights movement in history solely based on number of people involved. There are protests in all 50 states, which is unprecedented here in the U.S! We will have to wait and see just how impactful it turns out to be with lawmaking."
882,How is this even real? Aren't we taught in school how our right to protest is crazy important. Like wtf america. I've slowly gone from proud of my country to just embarressed over recent years.

This is inexcusable. This is abhorrent.

It's fucking un-American.

Edit: To everyone who says that ""this is America"" and that ""it has always been this way"", let me say this: your view of America is narrow.

I see a country with the capability of providing for all of it's citizens, black white, red, blue, and everything in between. A country that has the capacity to push past hatred, and unite together in common cause. I see a nation that has the ability to lead the way, to be a beacon for all of those who would be oppressed, starved, or forgotten. I see a nation that has the ability to reshape itself, to look into the mirror and recognize the need for change. A nation that enshrines the Inalienable Rights into law. We are a nation founded on our ideals. Our ideals are that all men are created equal, and that they're endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that include Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.

We CAN push past this. We WILL push past this. Let us unite together, and form a more perfect Union. Let us stand United against tyranny, hatred, and Those that would divide us. We can be heard.

We can change this Nation. There's still time."

900,"I am an Iranian who was born in Iran and moved to U.S. roughly 20 years ago when I was 15 years old. Over the years, I have gone back to Iran a few times, as recently as a year ago.

I have the same love for both Iran and the United States and I can attest that Iranian people truly love the American people and want nothing but peace and friendship with the Americans. Those who chant ""death to America"" are part of the Iranian government and account for a very small number of the population. Unfortunately the Iranian news outlets, which are run by the Iranian government only broadcasts these hateful idiots to try to influence the rest of the population, which has not worked well for them over the years. At the same time the U.S. media outlets also only shows those same hateful idiots for their own propagandas and to spread fear so they can manipulate people's emotions to get better ratings, because they have learned that nothing sells better than fear.
Please do not fall for these manipulative tactics by both sides and KNOW that you are truly loved by the Iranian people.

Edit: Thank you all for your lovely and warm responses. I have read them all, and I am very proud and happy to know that there are still MANY good hearted people out there who have genuine empathy for others.

I love you all and wish you all nothing but happiness for many years to come.

931,"[Here](https://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2018/12/Perspective_view_of_Korolev_crater) is the source of this image.  Per there:

> **Title** Perspective view of Korolev crater

> **Released** 20/12/2018 11:00 am

> **Copyright** ESA/DLR/FU Berlin,	CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO

> **Description**

> This image from ESA’s Mars Express shows Korolev crater, an 82-kilometre-across feature found in the northern lowlands of Mars.

> This oblique perspective view was generated using a digital terrain model and Mars Express data gathered over orbits 18042 (captured on 4 April 2018), 5726, 5692, 5654, and 1412. The crater itself is centred at 165° E, 73° N on the martian surface. The image has aresolution of roughly 21 metres per pixel.  

> This image was created using data from the nadir and colour channels of the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC). The nadir channel is aligned perpendicular to the surface of Mars, as if looking straight down at the surface.

EDIT: The comment below makes it sound like they used some CGI to make up some artist's rendition of what it would look like, that's not what this is at all. It's a real photograph, this one: http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2018/12/plan_view_of_korolev_crater/18937953-1-eng-GB/Plan_view_of_Korolev_crater_node_full_image_2.jpg

Then, since the picture is taken from above and they have a precise 3D map of the ground they just projected the picture on the 3D map so that we can see it from another angle, that's all. Which means, it's the same thing as when you look at google maps in 3D: it's real photos, and nobody claims, when they look at Google Maps in Satellite mode that it's ""a computer-generated image of the Earth"". When /u/pm_me_ur_big_balls claims it's ""a computer-generated image based on topographic data gathered"", it seems that he read somewhere how the 3D model of the ground was produced, not understanding the most important part: a real, high-res photograph of the ground was shot by ESA and projected on it. And no, they didn't ""just add the color"", the photograph was taken in color, as he quoted himself just above: the ""High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC)"" has color channels, it is a color camera.

I would also like to reject the claim that I am a collection of sticks, as my title didn't imply anything else."

947,What does Steph Curry think of this? ??
948,"OP, your title is a bit misleading:

* **The image is effectively a rending.**  ESA took a digital terrain model and photographs/images from Mars Express to make this computer-generated rendering.  It is an accurate view of what Korolev crater looks like, but it's not an actual ~~image~~ photograph.

* **The most recent imaging data was taken in April.**  This image was just *released*, but the data that was used to make it isn't so new.

And some facts that people seem to be confused about:

* **We've known about water ice on Mars for quite a while.**  Even before spacecraft we have been able to observe Mars' polar ice caps, which are made of both water and CO2 ices.  [Here's a movie from Mariner 7](http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/4-mars/2015/20150424_mariner7.gif) showing the northern ice cap in 1969.  For anyone interested in the history of the discovery of water on mars, see [this excellent wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_discoveries_of_water_on_Mars).

* **We've known there is ice in Korolev crater for a while too.**  [Here's an mosaic of Viking images](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Mars_NPArea-PIA00161.jpg) from the 1970s and 1980s showing Mars' north pole (Korolev is white circle at the 1-o'clock position, halfway from the center).

I don't want to seem like I'm coming down hard on OP, but I think it's important to share images of the planets with more context, as posts with almost no context can be misleading or a bit confusing.

Edit: For clarity, photograph is probably the least ambiguous word to use when referring to an image taken by a spacecraft camera.  Image can potentially refer to both photographs and renders, at least in non-scientific publications."
949,This is huge right? Especially for a Mars colony?
950,ITT: People didn't know we've observed water ice on Mars for over a decade. 
951,And so begins the Nestlé Spacé Racé.
952,Hope they don't harvest argent energy here.
953,"The title is a little misleading as this was not shot but generated using Mars data. What the artist does is generate a 3D model of the region, put the image of the ground as a texture ontop and set up a camera for a nice view. It's still real, it's just that this partcular angle would not be possible shooting images directly from the satellite.

1064,"I used to do overnight cleanup from NYE in Las Vegas for a big hotel/casino there. I actually loved doing it and looked forward to it as it was just funny most of the time. I would show up at 2am to start cleanup and mostly involved throwing any large trash into the street for the large sweepers to pick up and taking down fence and throwing it onto a truck. It was a big night for people watching.  Biggest observations from the nights:

- You constantly get hit on by drunk people even though they see you in uniform. Men and women alike.

- the amount of naked people is impressive every year. You think you've seen it all and then some naked woman dances in a fountain. 

- Yes, there are large amounts of pee, poop and vomit on the streets and sidewalks and it's always staggering the amount of women that are carrying their uncomfortable club shoes and walking barefoot through it down the strip. 

- Fights are constantly happening. Between everyone and the police are quick to step in and come from out of nowhere. It's pretty amazing to see. They have a handle on it almost immediately and are quick to pull a shirt up over your head from the front almost like a hockey fight. It's super quick to diffuse the situation. 

- I still don't know the reason why but the thing that always got me was the unbelievable amount of baby strollers you'd find discarded. We're not just talking about the cheap, fold up type but the 100+ dollar Graco type ones. They're always mangled and you just look in horror at it wondering where the baby is, whether it's safe and what kind of terrible parent brings a baby to New year's Eve on the Las Vegas Strip? I've personally thrown a LOT of them into the street for the sweepers to collect. 

All in all, I have to hand it to the police and city cleanup crews, they move through quick and clean up fast. I worked out there for almost 10 years and only saw 1 death on a night I was there as a civilian for 99/00 (man climbed a pole in front of Bellagio and grabbed power lines. Since then, most strip properties actually have poles removed from the front of their properties weeks before NYE) and haven't seen any real injuries. Hats off to the people that are part of the cleanup every year. It's hard work and you're exhausted afterward but it's unlike any other night of work you'll ever be a part of. "

She was taking money from an academic publisher and a for profit college which were conflicts of interest.  As well there was some oddness with the hiring of family members.  Students occupied the admin buildings in protest and Fire Katehi was graffitied all over campus.

Ultimately, the president of the UCs intervened.  UC Davis hired a guy from Georgia Tech to replace her.  He seems to be an improvement."
1082,"THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS IS RETURNING TO UC DAVIS. Chancellor Katehi the one who ordered the removal of the protesters was fired over her decision to do so. This year marks her return the school as a professor. Not only is she coming back but they are paying her THE SAME SALARY she had when she was chancellor(one of the highest paid people at the school).

The investigating task force strongly rebutted campus police claims that the Occupy demonstrators who had pitched tents on a UC Davis quad posed a violent threat.*


*In 2013, the former UC Davis police officer who pepper sprayed the campus protesters received $38,055 in workers' compensation after claiming he suffered depression and anxiety as result of the public outcry.*

The books are easy, but long and boring, my daughter reads much harder books, but there is nothing worse then reading a long boring book. I sit and watch her go through 4-5 pretty hard books for her age but can't get through 2 or 3 pages of those school books. Boring books don't encourage reading!!

1161,"I'm a teacher, a high school teacher. I have a love hate relationship with homework. First it's actually a lot of prep work for us. Second it's just one more thing the students have to do and our students are very busy because we are a full IB school. 

I would get rid of homework entirely but I feel our parents would react negatively to it so I've moved to weekly homework to give the students time to do it. I also only give complete/incomplete markings to homework, no grade. The idea is that the students need to do the homework to prepare themselves for success on assessments and to avoid giving too many ""buffer grades."" This is a principle of IB as well. 

I'm also trying to move most writing to in class instead of at home. It's going to eat into my time for lessons but it's important students learn to write on the spot by hand because they will be expected to do that during IB exams. "

1164,Just wait for the administration to step in and force the teacher to give homework. That's what mine did.
1165,"Going to go up against popular opinion here, but I'm not so sure that I agree with this. Homework, for me, effectively helped to discipline me in my studies. I may not have wanted to do it, but once I got started it helped reinforce what I learned and helped make material 'stick'. Without some of the ""outline this chapter"" homework I had in high school (that I was miserable while doing), I would have never been able to learn how to quickly skim an article for important information. Not until well into college at least. Homework was an effective means to train and learn good study habits that I still use today."
1166,"As someone with math/stat/science background, the claim that research shows homework has no influence is a bit strange.

All of the people I know with high academic performance have one thing in common, they practice. As in do all the homeworks and then more. Math, as an example, is a skill just like any other. It takes practice and repetition to be good at it. This is why Asian students coming to US doing their bachelors are generally very adapt at math problems - they were forced to do hours upon hours of practice a day during their schooling in China.

How old are the students?

I have flashbacks to elementary school, sitting at the dinner table at 8pm, getting scolded by my parents and being told I couldn't get up from the table to go to bed/sleep/play outside until I finished my homework; specifically math. I used to cry because I didn't understand what I was doing, and neither did my parents, they didn't understand the common-core way of solving equations. I can just imagine all the hours of my childhood I could have had if I wasn't stuck inside doing homework. I was on the Honor Roll list all the way until my first year of high school, after that I was completely burned out. I would take my current work/home life over my past school/home life 110%"

1179,"Reminds me of the movie Gung Ho, where Michael Keaton plays a businessman trying to make a pitch to some Japanese executives. 

> I am like, *crazy* for your country. I mean, I love it. You know, my Dad was over here with the Army in, I guess it was, Nineteen-forty-fi -- hey, did you decorate this place yourselves, because it's damn nice. It's... real... oriental, kind of a feel to it. Do you speak English, I'm just curious."
1180,"I actually did a coop placement at one of the offices across from the imperial palace. It's to the right of this picture, just off-frame a bit. My manager told me that that building, including three other buildings next to our's, was the most expensive real estate in all of Japan. Just a low-to-mildly interesting fact for you."
1181,Tell us about the day you decided to recreate this and how long it took from inception to capture.
1182,Excellent photo recreation and a great example of how the Fushimi-yagura Keep in the background has remained unchanged despite hundreds of years of development around it.
1183,"Very cool! My great-grandparents actually lived in Japan for about a year in the 1930s and my grandfather went to high school there.  I know he was big into photography so would be interesting if there were any from that time, but my aunt tossed a bunch unfortunately. 
 Most of the photos I've seen were from the 1950s/60s.

1185,Thank God they finally installed that safety railing.
1186,"Photos like these always force you to recognize what a vast change the world has undergone in the last century. Some countries more than others, but even beyond technology just the mindset of most individuals has to be radically different.

Quite impressive that you were able to take this picture with barely anyone else in view."
1187,It's weird that they replaced the tree with an even bigger one?
1188,I really like that the tree's still there.

**Obligatory Edit:** Whoa, this got waaaaay more attention that I was *sure* it would (not get)....  Never again will I underestimate being late to a thread, which has thousands of comments already, and just adding my little comment into the mix too.

1223," Policies aside. The x factor here was charisma and communication. Obama is a great public speaker, very down to Earth, and he oozes charisma. Having these traits will take you from a relatively unknown senator to a President lickity split. Really something. I've always been critical of him but damn you can't help but like him."
1224,"looking at pics of obama is like looking at pics of myself as a kid.

i was so happy and my skin was gorgeous..and now trump skin. how have i/we gone so backwards."
1225,"Commented this as a reply first, but it also stands alone well here.


I was sadly in the Fox News camp from my teens to my early 20s. I got out and saw the light of progressivism in 2014. Anyway...

I spent a LONG TIME internalizing hate for President Obama. They program it into you. To be sure, the man could’ve done better in some (even a lot) of areas, BUT - he was professional, he never lost his shit, and he was and is a good, natural leader. He’s also bright as fuck as has a degree in constitutional law - something that Glenn Beck will never tell you. 

In short, I have spent the past few years noticing candids and cute photo ops for the first time. Like this one, Fox would’ve never shown any of them because they make Obama look human."
1226,I may not have agreed with most of his policies...... But fuck I miss having a president that people respected.

1233,People who actually try hard at their job make schools better.
1234,"Oh man. I loved my elementary school lunch lady. Her name was Paula, and I never even got hot lunches. Mine were always sent with me. But she also worked the YMCA shifts, and I was a before and after school kid with the Y. To this day her and the gym teacher were my two fav “teachers” of all time. They were so good to me, and to so many other kids. 

This lady likes her job and her kids. It’s wonderful to see people still caring in this world. This makes me so insanely happy."
1235,"This is precious! The more you look, the more details you find. Even little things like paper poinsettia flowers are adorable! (And probably the only thing I could come remotely close to replicating, lol!)"
1236,South Park has taught me not to trust those animals.
1237,This is so sweet.  My mom is a lunch lady so they always have a weird place in my heart.
1238,She deserves to get paid for that kind of skill
1239,"Mods, if I do a follow up post tomorrow and create her a go fund me for a reddit Xmas bonus, would that be allowed?"
1240,At least one of them is a South park Christmas critter
1241,"This took so much time and love. I appreciate your dedication to the kids and I appreciate you, kind lunch lady."
1242,NGL the most valuable relationship I made in school was with the lunch ladies. Always had extra food on my plate.
1243,A real life angel!
1244,Looks like a woodland critter Christmas!
1245,Every school has that one wholesome precious support staff member that must be protected at all costs.
1246,What an absolute joy
1247,"If someone setup a way to donate money and could prove the money would go directly to this lovely lady I’d  throw in.

Good on her."
1248,Well done!
1249,"This needs to go viral! I bet she treats every single student with love , respect and kindness. There should be more recognition for support staff like her- they make a school too!"
1250,The women in the front left looks incredibly life-like!
1251,"I wonder how many other people are wasting their amazing talents because the current structure of society forces people into taking jobs just for security.

She deserves to be doing this for a living and not slaving away in a hot kitchen in an essentially thankless and forgotten about job.

If anyone out there owns an art/decoration business, hire her!"
1252,This comment will be probably be buried. I was a pretty troubled child back in the day. I remember every teacher and every lunch lady that showed me kindness and paitence. I'll never forget the positive influence they had on me.
1253,Now that's a lunch lady land I wouldn't mind visiting. Amazing!! Very talented and I'm sure the kids love it.
1254,No student can escape the magic of Lunchlady Land
1255,A woodland critter Christmas anyone?..
1256,Wow! That’s awesome she’s talented and a great staff member to the school.

1261,"My parents was the opposite. They never kept health records, and every time a school wants vaccination records, I get a new series of shots. We moved often.

Last time it was for college, after that I took over my own health records. Then the army also gave me additional shots.

So I am probably the most vaccinated man ever."

1266,Congratulations for living long enough to get vaccinated. 
1267,"Sooo, how’d you start the process? I want to get vaccinated but been a bit nervous.... did you just call up your regular doctor and say you’re not vaccinated and want to be? How many appointments would it take to be completely caught up? Do they need a 2nd round or are you good to go after 1 dose?"
1268,Vaccines cause adults

1270,"Today I took my 2 month old for his first round of vaccines. He's having a tough time with the side effects right now but I know it's worth it.

I'm from a developing country in the Caribbean. We have a lot of societal issues but I'm thankful that we prioritize vaccinating our children.

 Medicine has progressed to the point where infant mortality rates are fractions of what they were even 30 years ago. 

I refuse to risk the resurgence of diseases like mumps and measles. Parents, for the good of the individual and the collective vaccinate your children."
1271,Hmm. I haven't had any vaccines since I was maybe 12 years old.  I am now 52. I wonder if I should do something about that?  (seriously)
1272,This is a friendly reminder to set your pens forward to 2019. 
1273,"My brother and I went to live with our grandma when we were 13 and 10 respectively. We were taken out of catholic school, put in public school where vaccines were mandatory, and now we aren’t dead. It’s lovely. "
1274,"As someone who has had 2 heart transplants and cancer, and thus have a suppressed immune system and can't get all my vaccines, thank you for helping prevent people like me from dieing from preventable diseases.

Edit: forgot to add prevent from ""help people like me"""
1275,"Congratulations.  


It drives me absolutely insane that in Ontario (Canada) we still use this stupid paper form to track immunizations."
1276,Sorry about your stupid parents
1277,Wait you can get vaccinated for chickenpox? I was made to go to 'chickenpox parties' when I was a kid!!! 
1278,I love how the person who filled the form made the 2018/9 boo-boo. 
1279,"In Canada, you’re allowed to go see a doctor without your parents at age 14"
1280,Thank you for caring about the rest of humanity and congratulations on getting vaccinated. I hope the shots didn't hurt too much and that you don't have any crummy side effects.
1281,Are you feeling more or less autistic?

1283,"I am a grown adult man who is immunocompromised.

He’s ALWAYS sick and has no immune system. Let me tell you right now people...ESSENTIAL OILS ARE NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR VACCINES!!! My son is living proof!! Also children can have allergies to some oils and they can really mess them up. This is all information I have gathered by watching my son live it, not information gathered from social media posts. "

1382,"A very good, but horrifically graphic explanation of the Tiananmen Square Massacre (committed by the CCP) [~~can be found here.~~](https://imgur.com/a/AIIbbPs)  (See edit 4) Its a long, but very good read, with a lot of largely unseen photos from the incident.

Absolutely NOT SAFE FOR WORK.

Edit- Linked to the Imgur site as its easier to read than the initial post (Imgur imbed makes you flip through photos individually on reddit).  The original post was made a year or so by u/GoreGirl89 in the subreddit r/crimescene.  [It can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrimeScene/comments/flbntz/chinas_tiananmen_square_massacre/), and she posted several links to additional footage and survivor testimony.

Edit- Huh.  I just picked up a couple of weird, new followers with weird new accounts.........

Edit 2- also not responding to random unsolicited chats.  Please earn social credit some other way.

Edit 3- Which one of you sickos gave this the ""wholesome"" award???!!!

Edit 4- Ok all.  The above link got deleted.  You know.  For some reason. **FORTUNATELY SOMEONE BACKED IT UP TO THE INTERNET ARCHIVE YESTERDAY!!!!** Whoever you are, fantastic call. [Web archive link can be found here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210603183747/https://imgur.com/a/AIIbbPs)  There is a good lesson to be learned here when it comes to censorship.  Internet archive, a free online library, can take snapshots of any website in time, and stores them, for ever.  If you see something that you feel may get removed, [use this tool!!!!](https://web.archive.org/)

Final Edit- Ok, so from the looks of it, the web archive was only able to save some images.  Better than nothing, but no where near the complete picture and a lot of the ones that needed to be seen were not archived with the site.  Another user on here has reached out to the original poster from last year to see if they are able to scrounge up the original document.  Hopefully someone grabbed them before it was censored on Imgur.  If an updated link is found, Ill post it.  Im glad this got the attention it did, but unless we can recover the post, I sadly think this has run its course.

Ok, maybe not final edit.  u/Chiizukeeki managed to find [another working archive link.](https://archive.ph/7Tdzh) And I was able to find some more information.  ~~The collection appears to be from a photographer Dario mitidieri,~~ who appears to have released a 25 year anniversary publication of the images. I cannot find an original source, but hopefully that is enough info to get some internet sleuths digging, to keep this going in case the archive link gets removed.

Yet another edit as I sort through my inbox.  The entire collection of photos, to include a WHOLE lot more, are hosted at [Getty images, here](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/tiananmen-square-1989?agreements=pa:12695,ed:9003&excludenudity=true&family=editorial&phrase=Tiananmen%20square%201989&sort=mostpopular#license).  The site purely hosts images, so there is not the same narrative, but there are a LOT more images of equal graphic and non-graphic content. Message was sent to me as a PM so I wont release the other user name unless he/she wants me to give credit here.  With the shenanigans going on, Im not sure who else wants to be attached to this publicly."

1386,Except this was before the tank guy. This picture happened on the 4th. Tank guy was the 5th.
1387,Fuck CCP
1388,This shit is always so depressing man. It feels like the castration of a nation. These young Chinese people fought like hell for what they believed in and in the end their efforts were futile. It’s in some way inspiring but at the same time could see how it would be extremely discouraging for future generations to fight for there freedom too. Just sadness all around.
1389,And yet we continued to build up their economy in exchange for cheap labor. China has never been our friend and it was always crazy to think otherwise. Ask the relatives of these people if any of them are still alive.
1390,"I just watched the live footage of the massacre and “..two ambulance drivers were shot and killed.” As well as “..people were shot while sitting in their homes.”

Wtf"
1391,"I wonder why the future outcomes of this will be now that a lot of people are becoming more aware.

The Tiananmen Square protests, known in China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: ????; pinyin: liùsì shìjiàn), were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square, Beijing during 1989. In what is known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre (Chinese: ??????; pinyin: Ti?n'?nmén dà túsh?), troops armed with assault rifles and accompanied by tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square. The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared martial law and sent the People's Liberation Army to occupy parts of central Beijing. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.[2][3][4][5][6][7] The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: ????; pinyin: B?ji? mínyùn) or the Tiananmen Square Incident (Chinese: ?????; pinyin: Ti?n'?nmén shìjiàn)"

1486,"Nancy Pelosi is a fucking masters class on business dress for women. There is a fun Nancy Pelosi story in Obama's new book for those who have not read it.

When Ted Kennedy died the dems lost the 60th vote they needed to pass the ACA. The house had passed a version and the Senate passed their version. Passing the same version through both was impossible and the ACA was dead with Kennedy's passing. One of Obama's adviser's suggested that they see if Nancy would be willing to pass the Senate version. That meant she would have to go back get the votes again on a version that they did not like. They could then later try to fix it through reconciliation. This is the reason Nancy famously said, ""We have to pass it to see what is in it"", which she caught hell for.

So Obama called Nancy where he presented the option to her to have the House pass the Senates bill.  She apparently went on a 15 minute rant about how it would be impossible and that it was BS how not one GOP senator would help on healthcare. When she finally stopped ranting to take a breath Obama said, ""So...does that mean you are with me?"" She immediately shot back, ""Of course I am with you! There is no way we are going to reward the GOP by just giving up."" She then apparently then started going over how she was going to make it happen and who she would have to pressure. When Obama hung up the phone he looked at his advisers and said, ""Damn I love that woman.""

Side note: There was a public option in the Senate version but Joe Lieberman would not vote for it with it in there. You can literally thank Joe for the reason there is a not a public option."

1560,"Genuine question, how do they find jurors for a case this high profile?"
1561,"May I offer a suggestion......

There is some talk here that Thomas Lane, the lowest ranking officer, twice questioned Chauvin.  The concensus being that it is very difficult for a 1st year rookie to challenge a twenty year veteran in any industry.   Thus making him just a guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.  

This looks to me to be a similar problem that airline industry had to deal with in the 1970's

https://mynorthwest.com/5190/cockpit-culture-boeing-trains-pilots-to-challenge-each-other/

""In 1977, two Boeing 747s crashed in the Canary Islands – the deadliest accident in history with 583 fatalities – because the captain of one of the jets ignored warnings that he didn’t have clearance for takeoff.""

""Then In 1978, A United Airlines jet crashed in Portland, Oregon, killing 10 people because the co-pilot and flight engineer didn’t speak up. 
The captain had ignored the flight engineer’s warnings that the plane didn’t have enough fuel to land safely. As the tanks ran dry, the junior crew members said nothing.""

The airlines had to change the cockpit culture so that the junior pilots could challenge the senior pilots and the senior pilots would listen to them.

My suggestion is that one of the things we need to change is the ""Squad Car Culture""  of our police departments in the same way the airline industry changed the cockpit culture.

Edit:  Thank you for my first gold!"
1562,"I’m an officer with roughly the same amount of experience as Lane, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. George Floyd was murdered by these officers, and it could’ve been prevented. These officers need to see the light of justice. This is not me defending the officers actions, but trying to provide some insight, particularly with Lane.

I read that Lane spoke up twice to Chauvin, and Chauvin responded in a manner that disregarded Lane. The fact that Lane spoke up to a senior officer with two decades of experience is astonishing to me. The culture of a police department is hierarchy based, and newer officers work under not only the impression that the senior officer is right, but that the senior officer is always looking out for everybody and their best interests when that is often not the case. 

From what I’ve read Lane was out of field training for three days. As such I imagine that there’s a good chance he was working a brand new shift, with officers that are brand new to him, working an area that he’s unfamiliar with. It’s a terrifying experience. I still remember being on my first week out of field training, I felt like a new kid in a new school, and I was scared. 

During use of force scenarios, Ive personally seen many officers get tunnel vision and lose view of the situation as a whole. The fact Lane managed to avoid that tunnel vision, recognize the force was excessive, and speak up to a senior officer in a use of force scenario under these circumstances should be recognized. Was it too little? Absolutely. If more direct action was taken could the murder of Floyd have been prevented? Once again, absolutely. But Lane did more than what most seniors officers would’ve done, and he was still a rookie. 

This situation, and countless others that preceded it, could have been avoided. Action needs to be taken in the future to prevent ANYTHING like this happening again. I believe the issues comes down the culture of police work, and a paradigm shift is needed. The job changes people who aren’t conscious of it. It needs to be recognized and addressed. I’ve heard officers say the goal of this job is to arrest people, and that is simply not true. The goal should always be to help the situation however best one can in the moment. The mindset of getting as many arrests as possible leads to unnecessary aggression, and even worse is it’s often celebrated. This career field needs people who are outraged by this, and are empathetic and want to make a positive change. It needs people who will not lose sight of that goal."

Edited to add: 
Thank you to everyone who had genuine comments and helped educate myself and others about the situation as a whole. Thank you as well to those who enabled it possible for so many of us to have a genuine conversation about it too. 

I’ve read the vast majority of comments this morning following my original comment and I just wanted to clarify some things. 

I’m not making excuses for any of them. Having heard further details about all of them via comments here and elsewhere, in particular Lane (bottom left), while he was there and was apart of it.. he was also quite new, wanted to make a genuine difference, helped others, stood up to a senior officer and essentially got told to stand down. Sure, he could’ve done more but he at least raised concerns over Floyd’s welfare and tried. 

No, I don’t find any of them attractive and attraction had 0 influence on my genuine question. IMO, I don’t care if someone’s attractive. If they’ve committed a crime, they’ve committed a crime and need to be held accountable."
1567,"Derek Chauvin's wife filed for divorce, requested a last-name change and the titles for both of their homes.

Clearly they're moving ahead to protect their assets from the upcoming civil lawsuits.

1568,"I feel bad for Thomas Lane (bottom left). He was a rookie in his probationary period and still stood up to Chauvin, a 20 yr police veteran, twice. He was more courageous than most of us would have been in that situation and if he had attempted to physically restrain Chauvin, knowing his history of violence and considering the intensity of the situation, I have no doubt in my mind that Lane would have gotten very injured and eventually fired. 

He’s the only one in these mugshots who looks conflicted and pained. He tried in the moment and in hindsight he clearly wishes he did more. Lane is the only one in these mugshots who clearly regrets what happened on that day, and that should be taken into account. He was at the wrong place at the wrong time and did as much as he could, he shouldn’t have to pay for the mistakes of others considering he at least tried to prevent this.

Edit: It is perfectly okay that some of you disagree with me, but I just want to add, it’s incredible how you people hate Lane so much. Chauvin definitely deserves the hate because he killed a man, but Lane, he followed the orders of an experienced officer while still questioning his actions. You guys don’t hate him because he killed Floyd but because he didn’t stop it. It is wrong for you to have so much contempt for a man simply because he didn’t meet your expectations, because, let’s face it, If you guys were in his shoes, most of you would not have had the courage to stop Chauvin either. 
He is still human, he tried, maybe not as hard as you would have wanted, but he did, and he will live with his failure for the rest of his life because unlike the other officers, Lane didn’t have a history of violence or disorderly conduct, he was a good guy and a good cop, he just didn’t do what you expected of him."
1569,What’s the cop whose been on the force for 3 damn days doing here?  Supposedly he stepped in and told Chauvin to lay off

Now do Breonna Taylor's killers!"
1574,"I want to KNOW WHY NOBODY (news media, etc..) has NOT mentioned that every superior above these cops should be fired and also held accountable. The main offender (Chauvin) has like 16+ offences/complaints against him. If his superiors were doing their jobs, Chauvin would probably have been fired already and George Floyd would probably be alive. I can't believe this hasn't been brought up yet"
1575,"I was watching LA92 on Netflix today and it struck me that while there was some looting/protesting before the trial, when the verdict came out things quickly went belly up after the officers were acquitted.  

  

The protesting, rioting, and looting that happened (Mostly due to police aggression), will be like a puppy barking if they acquit Chauvin.  Like, if they don't find him guilty of murder AND sentence him to a lengthy sentence, this country's cities will burn to the ground.  I highly recommend that documentary, the reaction after the acquittal of the Korean store clerk and the officers is poignant, and in the case of King wasn't even a death."

>First of all, to clear the air on my biases. I believe George Floyd was murdered by Derek Chauvin. In fact, I believe it could be elevated to 2nd Degree murder, over 3rd. Additionally, I am not trying to comment on the guilt or innocence of any of the other involved officers aside from Chauvin and Lane (bottom left). I'm not even necessarily advocating for all charges to be dropped on Lane. I'm simply trying to provide a perspective that I have not seen discussed. [https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/gw0ft8/the\_case\_for\_former\_officer\_thomas\_lane/](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/gw0ft8/the_case_for_former_officer_thomas_lane/)  
>  
>Here are the facts. During the course of Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck for over 8 minutes Thomas Lane spoke up twice.  
Did he do enough? Clearly not. However, I think context is important.  
Thomas Lane was still in his probationary period while Chauvin had been on the force for 19 years. Thomas lane found himself assisting a veteran of nearly two decades after only graduating from the academy in March of last year. Lane had been on the force for just over a year and yet he still questioned Chauvin twice.  
Lane asked “should we roll him on his side” and Chauvin allegedly responded: “That’s why we have him on his stomach.”  
“I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,"" Lane said, according to the charging document, before Chauvin allegedly answered: “That’s why we have him on his stomach.”  
Look at this training slideshow about [Excited Delirium](https://www.slideshare.net/citinfo/chcs-sharedepartmentsjail-diversion2009-diversion-initiatives1-cit-international-conference-20101-power-pointspower-pointsjerry-staton-cit-conf-excited-delirium)

...

>Lane, a rookie, still remembered his training and questioned Chauvin, a veteran of nearly two decades, on his conduct. Not once, but twice even after being shot down the first time.  
Have you ever spoken up to a superior who you know is doing something wrong? Have you done it twice after they tell you to shut up the first time? Maybe you have or could, but you can't say it's easy.  
Did Lane do enough? Absolutely not. Should he be tried for the same crime as Chauvin, or even the other two cops? I don't believe so. Additionally, this information is even more damning for Chauvin. It proves that, not only did he act in a reckless and violent manner that resulted in the death of George Floyd, but he was consciously aware that he was flouting training, and of the risks of his actions AS HE WAS IN THE ACT, because even a rookie was warning him.  
Had Chauvin possessed an ounce of human decency or the humility to listen to the rookie cop assisting him, George Floyd may still be alive today.  
If Lane, as an unsure rookie, had the balls to physically tackle and restrain a veteran of nearly two decades during an active arrest, maybe George Floyd would still be alive.  
However, that's an incredible thing to ask of someone.  
Prior to this, no community member had ever filed an official complaint against Thomas Lane (Compared with Chauvin's 20 complaints and 2 letters of reprimand). If the roles were reversed, and Lane had the opportunity to remain on the force for nearly 20 years like Chauvin, and Chauvin were the rookie, maybe George would still be alive, and maybe there would be one more considerate cop - albeit somewhat gutless in the face of authority - on the streets."
1577,These guys couldn't get a fair trial on the moon.  This one will put the 6th amendment to the test.
1578,Chauvin literally looks like a psychopath. If you told me he shot up someplace I wouldn’t be surprised
1579,Former cops.
1580,"It's incredible to the the compassion coming forth for someone who (at least to me) seems genuinely destroyed over their participation in this act. 
Knowing his position, and in this job field... in the immediacy of the video first being released I remember thinking
""in all honesty, beyond yelling at them and filming... what could I do without putting my own life at risk and then there are two of us in the street..."" and I felt a mixture of guilt, selfishness, and just a sick feeling of the hypothetical hanging there.
Now thinking about being in that same position, but these guys have control over your career, family life, reputation... hell if they wanted to, they could pin anything that went wrong on the one guy who ""didnt have their backs""...
This is just another reason why we need complete reform. 



If the police are afraid to even stand up to other police... WTF?!?!"

Another one of these people has their eyes bulging out like a power-hungry sociopath.

I can’t get myself to watch the video of the murder. It’s too difficult for me to bear. But without having seen it, and with no idea who any of these men are, it’s painfully obvious from these mugshots who the murderer is.

This is a guy that who was already in the top 1% before elected, and now makes almost 200k per year from his salary, more than a whole hell of a lot of people who actually work for a living, so that he can protect a fake billionaire from a legitimate impeachment, and protect other real billionaires and corporate profits from proper government intervention, while a 20  or 100 dollar bill is just sticking out of his pocket. The obliviousness is astounding.

I am poor and have been poor for most of my life, I volunteer, and the only thing I want to do is help the poor, working and middle classes to have better lives through things like a raised minimum wage and Medicare for All, and ""Munchies for Lunchies"", my bill to legalize marijuana and use the tax revenue to pay for every child's school lunch in NC.

1742,"*""Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually changing opinions, slowly eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures.""*

Said by JFK in September '63, but just as true today. It would really be something if this were the beginning of a lasting and spreading peace. To that end, I hope the best for the Koreas. And for everyone else. "
1743,"Kim Jong Un's voice is super soft and pleasant, that surprised me for sure.

“I would like to pay tribute to the courageous and bold decision made by you chairman Kim to arrange our meeting,” he said.

“Over the past seven decades we weren’t able to communicate, so I think we can talk the whole day today,"" Moon said, drawing laughs from Kim.

> The death toll from the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre was at least 10,000 people, killed by a Chinese army unit whose troops were likened to “primitives”, a secret British diplomatic cable alleged.

> The newly declassified document, written little more than 24 hours after the massacre, gives a much higher death toll than the most commonly used estimates which only go up to about 3,000.

> It also provides horrific detail of the massacre, alleging that wounded female students were bayoneted as they begged for their lives, human remains were “hosed down the drains”, and a mother was shot as she tried to go to the aid of her injured three-year-old daughter.

1778,"I think the other photo is popular for the same reason Schindler's List is popular, or that Hotel Rwanda was more popular than Shooting Dogs. People like focusing on the flower growing on the battlefield, and prefer not to think too much about the rotting corpses next to it. "

1780,"Censorship is real. I am a decently educated 36 year old person and I've never seen this photo before. Shit, I don't even know how many people died here....?? "
1781,"This is so very true, and a lot of what really happened still isn't known by many there. I was just in Beijing a few months ago and had the opportunity to visit and talk with my guide and she was saying how she mostly knew nothing about it until very, very recently thanks to methods of bypassing the Great Firewall becoming more accessible. The majority of citizens there still don't know what really happened, and those who do know don't discuss much due to the shame."
1782,I was talking about this a few weeks ago. It's interesting that the iconic image of Tienanmen square is of a protester standing in front of a tank that is \*STOPPED\*.   The imagery we see gives the impression that the peaceful protesters were successful not that shortly thereafter the military violently put down the protest. 
1783,10 thousand people.
1784,"The iconic picture tells a far more optimistic story- that in spite of towering odds people will summon immense courage to stand up for their beliefs.

This image is the cold reality of the consequences of those actions. It’s no surprise one is more popular than the other."
1785,This is horrifying and should never be forgotten.
1786,Don’t worry guys! Reddit right now is going through some rounds of investment. Right now one of their larger investors is a company largely responsible for the internet censorship in China. In short time things like this will be removed for you before you have the misfortune to see them!
1787,Pretty crazy Reddit decided to take 150 million from a Chinese censorship giant.  
1788,"Our tour guide in China said hundreds died that day but...it was silenced. Other thing? Yeah, not a Communist country anymore *but* it is Totalitarian state. People have money, displayed all the time and others do not, but the crackdown is real. The violations in Human Rights are legion. "
1789,"It's weird why the other Tienanmen picture grabbed as much fame.  The people didn't win.  

The Chinese government completely flattened over their people.  "
1790,"My mother was there during 1989.

She was a student, and was protesting with a incredibly large hoard of students.  The tanks suddenly came, and dismantled the rebellion. She was trying to run away, when suddenly she was pushed down onto the ground.  That almost meant inevitable death beyond the huge crowd of people by all means would be willing to trample over you to escape, and imminent tanks behind her. She told me how scared she was and how she thought it was the end of her life.  But suddenly, a nearby police officer pulled her hand up.  She was saved.  He told my mom to ""get the fuck out of here"" in Chinese.  She got out of Tiananmen square as fast as she could.  She managed to live and stay strong like she is today?"
1791,Why don't you ask the kids at Tienanmen Square?
1792,"Protestors were given a time to clear out and they started to flatten people to make ""meat pie"" earlier than the time given. A lot of the people in power then are in power now in the Chinese government. Most people in China are not aware that this even happened. They knew there was some sort of protest but it got ""resolved""."
1793,For real. Fuck the Chinese government and their efforts to influence the West through reddit and popular culture. 
1794,$150M Chinese investment? Let's see how long this post can go without being deleted

1802,This should be an album cover
1803,"This stuff is called VitalOxide (or is something similar). The company my dad works for is a distributor of it.

Quoted from the website:  ""Vital Oxide is an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant cleaner, mold killer, and odor eliminator. Its formula contains a unique form of stabilized chlorine dioxide that is very effective at killing bacteria, viruses, and mold yet non-corrosive to treated articles and gentle enough to handle without causing skin irritation. It is ready to use with no mixing required—just spray, wipe, or fog right from the bottle.""

While his company doesn't make this stuff, they are an authorized distributor, and also manufacture some of the machines used to disperse it. The machines give the chemical particles a static charge as they are forced out of the nozzle, thus causing the particles to stick to most surfaces.

They are currently overwhelmed with over 1000 orders that they are unable to fill, as their supplier cannot keep up with the demand.

Hopefully this clears up some of the confusion and worries."

1830,"This is my latest effort to show you how our moon looks through a telescope. It was done by using a telescope at 2000mm and capturing 24,000 individual photos. 4 panels with 6,000 photos each (my camera works at crazy high framerates) allowed me to take the best frames where the atmosphere disturbed the image the least and combine them, stitching together a mosaic of all the images. This allowed me to get crazy details and contrast on a relatively noise-free image.

I can't help but wish him success in his new government position that seems to have worried your right wing.  I think he is the most underappreciated politician in the states and I think you'd have trouble finding a Canadian who disagrees with me.  We all watch what's going on down there, it's way more interesting/exciting/like a reality tv show than our politics.  I'm looking forward to seeing what effect he has on the next government."

2019,Was talking to someone at work yesterday who told me that it's a hoax and the numbers are all made up. I didn't even bother talking to her any further.
2020,Notice that the sign isn’t anti-Trump. It’s not pro-Biden. It’s a fact. Something Trump and his supporters are very uncomfortable with.
2021,"Funny how in the states, acknowledging that yes the virus does exist is a political statement."
2022,"Do all Trump fans think Coronavirus is a hoax? Or is it just that everyone who thinks it's a hoax is a Trump fan?

This gigantic yard display doesn't seem to be directly anti-Trump at all."

2029,It's so sad that USA has tied politics to covid
2030,Remember when we used to care that Americans were dead?  I remember watching 9-11 in high school and really caring that Americans were dead.

2047,"I operate a retail business and there is an active minority of anti maskers that always cause upset and disrupt our business. They come in, chinstrap mask or in dicknose mode which makes compliant shoppers scared and uncomfortable.   They’re the ones who hurt business and create a sense of fear and danger in our environment when we try to set up as safe a place as possible.   We can only ask them to don their mask properly or leave if they refuse and hope they do leave peacefully when asked. 

Anti maskers are small time petty terrorists who truly do, as reported by science journals, display sociopathic ways.  Their refusal to cooperate with this social contract of doing what we can to make ourselves safe for others is a baffling misjudgment of what it means to live and respect the rights of others to not be exposed to potential harm.   They want to swing a chainsaw in a crowded place because they think it’s a fundamental right they’re entitled to.  No it’s not and get out of my fucking shop."
2048,I work at Jersey Mikes! We need a sign like this but with less words. Our customers still try to eat at the tables even though there’s signs on them that say TABLES ARE CLOSED. -__-

2056,"That's interesting. 

In Mexico the constitution says that in case of a health emergency, the citizens must obey the government and some constitutional rights can be temporarily suspended (not removed) so, wearing a mask and confining to your house could be made mandatory. 

Sure Mexicans, being the party animals that we are, did not liked things like alcohol prohibition and being forced to wear a face mask in public places... but it was nevertheless mandatory."

Sleepover at my friend's house in the basement of his split level.  Mario 64 and Zelda OOT, but he didn't have Smash Bros (or another controller) so we just had to take turns.  I was bad at taking turns so I hope he forgives me all these years later.  He was such a good friend he'd let me borrow the N64 for a few nights at a time so I could grind through a game, since my family was too poor/cheap to get one.

I decided maybe I should reach out to some mutual friends who use to come to said sleepovers and show them this picture...only to realize I don't talk to any of them anymore as we all had falling outs with one another.

Oh well, time moves on I suppose.  Mid 30s, time to move as time does."
2092,"Christ, did someone sneak into my buddy's house 25 years ago and snap a pic?  This is like the exact way his basement looked for a sleepover for his birthday once.  Probably 4 or 5 of us were there, same year and everything.  Watched Austin Powers, played video games he had an n64 and playstation, I brought my virtual boy haha.  

Don't think we had natgeo's though haha, we just tried to see if we could get cinemax to come through."
2093,Those were the days. I remember staying up playing Conker's Bad Fur Day on the N64 with my friends. We probably looked exactly like this when we eventually did pass out: sprawled across the living room floor.
2094,This is so perfect that it can’t be real.
2095,Classic
2096,"Dude life was so awesome back then. No worries, free summers, N64 rentals from blockbuster, gushers, gathering around the computer and hearing “WELCOME!” Late at night and having to turn the speakers down so the parents didn’t know we were online. Ah, nostalgia is a bitch"

2116,They seem like a fun couple.
2117,"Since this post is getting a bit of attention I wanted to make a few clarifications:

The roads are not dangerous as this new rule will be in motion in 2018 allowing women to learn how to drive, schooling of the police and even giving a chance for previously hired drivers to find new jobs. Allowing them to drive as a landmark moment in a society where gender roles have long been rigidly demarcated and strictly enforced is a big move. This was received well by the general public. Great move towards equality and a boost in the economy!"

2132,This feat is more impressive upon learning that she was stuck in Malaysia and had no access to proper training facilities due to lockdown. She is seen training in a gazebo of someone's backyard leading up to Olympics.
2133,"My favorite part of this is that it's truly a David and Goliath story. She came out on top above China, who arguably has the best weightlifting team in the world. If you aren't into weightlifting at all: China's sponsorship for their athletes and their sports is second to none and it shows through their medal-count and record-count. Their athletes are hand-picked from hundreds (possibly thousands) of kids and the state separates the wheat from the chaff, only allowing the best to compete.

Hidilyn went up against 'the machine' and won. I'm ecstatic for her and the Filipino people. What a moving moment in Olympic history."
2134,"More details: It’s the country’s first EVER Gold. Hidilyn Diaz recently called out the Philippine government  because of its lack of funding for the aspiring Olympians and athletes in general. She did this on her own. If our state grabs credit for it, don’t believe it. She won because she made it possible. Filipino athletes are world class of given the same opportunities. Mabuhay ka, Hidilyn! Thank you for this honor.

Edit: Hidilyn even asked for sponsorship from private companies in her instagram because the Philippine government couldn’t financially support her and the other athletes we’d send in the Olympics. Because of calling out our government, she was tagged as a communist (terrorist). She’s not the first one to do so and she won’t be the last. HER success gives hope to Filipino athletes that they also can. Hopefully, it will convince our government to financially support our athletes. 

This is a huge success for us. Thank you for celebrating it with 110 million Filipinos all around the world!

2137,So nice to experience the Olympics while using reddit. This is an example of something on my day to day life because I am not from the Philippines or watch sports often. Now I can be excited about this with my brothers and sisters from the Philippines.
2138,"I love how that look is the same across all the athletes. No matter what nationality, race, gender, etc they all seem to make a face roughly like this when they win. Just pure joy"
2139,"Great job! 

Also her numbers are pretty damn impressive."
2140,"Wow, this is an uplifting story."
2141,FYI this is WITHOUT the help of Philippine Sports Org. THEY REFUSE TO FUND THEIR ATHLETES.
2142,"Margi in the Woman's skateboard was such an incredibly cool customer, just stoked to be there and supporting everyone. I noted I couldn't think of a sport Phillipenes shows up in.

Apparently the answer was they don't, but hopefully answers like power lifting and skateboarding are the future answers. Inspirational."
2143,Hawaii is celebrating her
2144,"

In a session full of record-setting performances, Hidilyn Diaz of the Philippines wound up with two of those records and the gold medal in women's 55kg weightlifting, clinching both on her last lift.

The gold medal is the first ever for any athlete from the Philippines.

Muattar Nabieva of Uzbekistan set the Olympic record of 98kg in the snatch, where Diaz was unable to complete her attempt at 99kg. Nabieva was less of a factor in the clean and jerk and wound up in fourth behind Zulfiya Chinshanlo of Kazakhstan.

China's Liao Quiyun, who was tied with Diaz at 97kg after the snatch, set an Olympic record with 123kg in the clean and jerk, giving her an Olympic record total of 220kg. Diaz did one better, lifting 124kg for a total of 221kg. Liao answered with her last lift of 126kg for a total of 223kg. Diaz again attempted and completed a lift with one additional kilogram, finishing with 126kg in the clean and jerk and 224kg total.

Diaz was competing in her fourth Olympics and won silver in 2016. She was the country's flagbearer in 2012. –NBC"
2145,I live in the same city she's from and went to the same university where she started training for weightlifting. I think it's so awesome that I met an Olympics gold medalist. I'm so proud of her!

2147,That is Philippine awesome.
2148,"This is awesome!  


What KG was her division?  What did she clean and jerk? What did she snatch?"
2149,The feat brings an end to the Philippines' 97-year Olympic gold-medal drought. The nation first entered the Olympics in 1924.
2150,Nice! We also got a gold today
2151,"Makes me proud of her, Filipina power."
2152,"Major victory. Hidilyn has been at this sport for many years, when team China sends a weightlifter to the olympics, they are a virtual lock to get gold. This was a big upset."

2190,"My wife got diagnosed with malignant melanoma, which had metastasized to her lymph glands.  50% chance of being alive in two years.

There's treatment, but there's a lot of ""just wait and see"" to that diagnosis.  Five years means you're very most likely in the clear, 10 years means you're in the clear.  For the first five years... you just wonder if there's a timebomb.  Kinda sucks.

It's been 16 years!  She's happy, healthy, and loving life!  It's behind her, and only tickles at our memories from time to time.

A lot of people tell you ""you'll be a better person because of this"".  Well, that's true.  We have a much deeper level of compassion for people.  I still wouldn't wish the process on my enemy, though.  But, things like divorce; seriously?  After all that, neither of us would even CONSIDER divorce.  Hell no.
