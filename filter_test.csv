Even in Italy and China where we've seen the worst of this so far, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THEY COULDN'T SHIT? NONE. You know how many people have reported they couldn't shit because some asshole bought all the TP? A LOT.

Buy a bidet everybody, it's on Amazon for like $30 and you'll only need like 2 squares of TP for every shit after that, for eternity. If your store is out of lysol wipes, buy the spray bottle and use a cleaning rag. If they run out of bottled water, buy a filter for your tap.

When people come in all at one and clear the shelfs - they stock them same day and clear them again - it will be next day at worst 2 for them to restock but all of sudden their are pictures of empty shelfs and people panic even more and go into a buying frenzy and it just repeats - there is more then enough for everyone and if you didnt buy 10x more then you need for your selfish self theere would still be enough for everyone and then some and there would be no panic.

62,"*Police Sergeant Charles Langley then ordered Shaver, who was lying prone, to cross his legs. Moments later, he ordered Shaver to push himself ""up to a kneeling position."" While complying with the order to kneel, Shaver uncrossed his legs and Langley shouted that Shaver needed to keep his legs crossed. Startled, Shaver then put his hands behind his back and was again warned by Langley to keep his hands in the air. Langley yelled at Shaver that if he deviated from police instructions again, they would shoot him. Sergeant Langley told Shaver not to put his hands down for any reason. Shaver said, ""Please don't shoot me"". Upon being instructed to crawl, Shaver put his hands down and crawled on all fours. While crawling towards the officers, Shaver paused and moved his right hand towards his waistband. Officer Philip Brailsford, who later testified he believed that Shaver was reaching for a weapon, then opened fire with his AR-15 rifle, striking Shaver five times and killing him almost instantly. Shaver was unarmed, and may have been attempting to prevent his shorts from slipping down.*

1 OWS was the closest now WSB is on mark.

2 OWS lasted weeks, but when banks got scared, government stepped in, police cleared the streets in a night.

3 racial tensions/sjw became the new focus and OWS disappeared from media

4 media works for government works for banks.

My thesis has been that normal people are just as good as, if not better then, Wall Street at evaluating stuff like social media trends and the last week has been solid evidence towards my case.

There are countless hedge funds that could have identified and profited from the same opportunity before WallStreetsBets had the chance to get in, but they didn't. The only thing keeping them on top is the fact that they already have money.

OP is there one thing you wanted or needed to hear from your beautiful wife that she didn’t say? It needn’t be anything profound, just something extra that would have helped your heart heal. I don’t want to miss my chance, and I’m only getting one shot.

Godspeed, OP. I’ll tell your wife how you’ve touched so many with the pictorial story of your love when I see her on the next level. I imagine her peacefully and joyfully waiting for you, right by the gate.

Your love story has inspired that, help spread that love around the world and in doing so, make the world that little bit better.

Life I can imagine is not going to be easy to recover, but you'll find a way I truly hope. But as someone else has said, thank you for sharing your story and thank you for spreading a message of love without constraint around the world, because I believe you have.

The chances are unlikely, but if you ever find yourself in a city called Norwich in Norfolk, England, send me a message, I'd happily buy you a drink and have a chat and thank you in person and listen to what you have to share.

""Because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four, five times more, perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps 20. And yet it all seems limitless.""

Not everyone was so lucky to make it out in time safely and millions of people were separated from their families (to this day), killed or displaced.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-haystack-first-image-black-hole-0410

Looks like MIT's social media twitter account didn't collaborate with MIT's own news office since in reality, Katie Bouman did not lead any team at all or was a leader at all.

The actual leaders were Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael.

Notice how before this social media shilling on twitter, the MIT article only mentioned Katie Bouman once at the very end of the article.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-haystack-first-image-black-hole-0410

>The Haystack EHT team includes John Barrett, Roger Cappallo, Joseph Crowley, Mark Derome, Kevin Dudevoir, Michael Hecht, Lynn Matthews, Kotaro Moriyama, Michael Poirier, Alan Rogers, Chester Ruszczyk, Jason SooHoo, Don Sousa, Michael Titus, and Alan Whitney. Additional contributors were MIT alumni Daniel Palumbo, Katie Bouman, Lindy Blackburn, Sera Markoff, and Bill Freeman, a professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

How long before this MIT article written by MIT themselves gets taken down and rewritten to give Katie Bouman a whole paragraph to herself?

When will the mainstream media take responsibility for inaccurate reporting? Why is there such a glaring difference between one of MIT's twitter accounts versus their own press release?

Why were the 2 leaders: Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael completely ignored by everybody else?

4 teams around the world.

American team was ked by Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael.

Nowhere it is mentioned that Katie Bouman led the American team, just only these 2 males who were co leaders.

Where did this Katie Bouman was leader originate from? Even MIT's own news article doesn't mention this.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-haystack-first-image-black-hole-0410",
471,"Tuns out she did a sub, sub, sub part of a program. A sort of 'adaptor' that just reformats certain data into another format, and then feeds it into the ACTUAL program.

That misrepresentation of what she actually contributed and what she actually did is nauseating. Either nepotism on the part of the institution or the media.

Sources:

Here is what she wrote (hopstools): https://github.com/klbouman/hopstools

Here the mother program where that optional part of her is added, where it acts as a sort of interface to import one more datatype by reformatting it.

Source: https://github.com/sao-eht/eat/graphs/contributors

It's kinda ridiculous how the media morphs this into something COMPLETELY different.

Btw, that's also NOT an algorithm, but just reformatting data.

---

You don't understand, she did NOT write and algorithm at all. She did NOT write an image tool at all.

What she did code is at max about 4 pages of code, but more importantly, that's neither an algorithm nor a imaging program, but an ADAPTOR for a source of data which reformats the data to feed it into the mother program of which she contributed that adaptor, which makes up 0.01% of said mother program at max AND is marked as ""optional"" part of the program.

Source: https://github.com/sao-eht/eat/graphs/contributors

---

Her whole bundle (hopstools) here was merged into the mother program and counted as one commit of 'mother' program. hopstools, of which she did at max 25%, so her share on contribution on this actual imaging program is about 0.3% max, but OK, lets say 1%, so she did less than 1/4 of 1% of the work. Max. If we're very generous.

This little part is the share that her contribution does. And again, hopstools is just an adaptor for another data 
format that can be read into the 'mother' program. That's it.

Andrew Chael wrote 850k out of the 900k lines of code (a lot of it is auto generated lines, but he contributed a large chunk of it). He was also the leader of the project. Michael D. Johnson wrote 12k lines of code. Chanchikwan wrote 5k lines of code.

The woman? Only wrote 2.4k lines of code.

Interestingly enough, the code she wrote was importing something called HOPStools.

Interestingly enough, if we go look at HOPStools and all its contributors, we get:

Weilgusm wrote 2.9k lines of code.

Chanchikwan wrote 676 lines of code.

Andrew Chael wrote 1.2k lines of code.

Jpbarrett wrote 71 lines of code.

Katie Bouman wrote 2 lines of code.

Hell, even on the hopstools thing, there is this in the summary:

For Katie:

cd /Users/klbouman/Research/vlbi_imaging/software/hops/build source hops.bash

run this file from: /Users/klbouman/Research/vlbi_imaging/software/hops/eat""

She also fixed absolutely none of the bugs on the EHT.

And the algorithm they talk about? It was plagiarized off of a Japanese guy named Mareki Honma who made the thing back in 2012, and uploaded/updated it to GitHub in 2016.

Andrew Chael asked to use it, Honma helped him adapt it, and was part of 60 Japanese people working on the project.

Katie Bouman also isn't following anyone at all on GitHub, and has basically only utilized it for these two projects: hopstools and EHT.

The second co-leader of the EHT imaging group is Kazunori Akiyama, with the first being Andrew Chael.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-haystack-first-image-black-hole-0410

Looks like MIT's social media Twitter account didn't collaborate with MIT's own news office since in reality, Katie Bouman did not lead any team at all or was a leader at all.

The actual leaders were Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael.

Notice how before this social media shilling on twitter, the MIT article only mentioned Katie Bouman once at the very end of the article.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-haystack-first-image-black-hole-0410

>The Haystack EHT team includes John Barrett, Roger Cappallo, Joseph Crowley, Mark Derome, Kevin Dudevoir, Michael Hecht, Lynn Matthews, Kotaro Moriyama, Michael Poirier, Alan Rogers, Chester Ruszczyk, Jason SooHoo, Don Sousa, Michael Titus, and Alan Whitney. Additional contributors were MIT alumni Daniel Palumbo, Katie Bouman, Lindy Blackburn, Sera Markoff, and Bill Freeman, a professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

How long before this MIT article written by MIT themselves gets taken down and rewritten to give Katie Bouman a whole paragraph to herself?

When will the mainstream media take responsibility for inaccurate reporting? Why is there such a glaring difference between one of MIT's Twitter accounts versus their own press release?

Why were the 2 leaders, Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael, completely ignored by everybody else?

4 teams around the world.

American team was led by Kazunori Akiyama and Andrew Chael.

Nowhere it is mentioned that Katie Bouman led the American team, just only these 2 males who were co-leaders.

Where did this ""Katie Bouman was a leader"" originate from? Even MIT's own news article doesn't mention this.

Katie Bouman did not invent the algorithm.

Multiple people are cited on the limited proof of concept thesis.

The actual research and development of practical application of this technology, as well as development of the algorithm itself, was done by a huge team of researchers, not Katie Bouman:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06226

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06226.pdf

https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205

This is the primary research that led to the possibility of imaging the black hole. Notice how the research cites Andrew Chael’s EHT imaging library (the guy who wrote 850,000 lines of code). Chael wrote the entire library. To not give him the same or preferably more credit than Bouman is pretty messed up.

https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/people/andrew-chael

Also, Katie Bouman did not lead or manage anything. These are the directors, managers, and affiliates:

https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/our-people

Katie Bouman does not deserve 100%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, or even 1% of the credit. There are so many people involved that made far more significant contributions (like Andrew Chael developing the EHT imaging library).

What has science come to when such incredible falsehoods about who contributed to research are perpetuated by the scientific community and mainstream media? It’s wrong.

Credit for this sleuthing goes to u/Dorkydor. I just fixed grammar.

The first Martian colony is surrounded by the Martian creatures. They close in on the unarmed astronauts, they've never tasted human blood, their mandibles are erect in anticipation. The astronauts hug one another, knowing this is the end. They look to the sky, hoping in vain to see a glimpse of the pale blue dot, the home they'll never see again. It's no use, the dust is too thick. Like many pioneers to this hellish world before them, they will perish under a red storm. They close their eyes and wait for death.

When suddenly a blast is heard, a scream, and then another and another. They open their eyes. A cloaked figure has appeared out of nowhere, and is raining fire down on the creatures from above. They flee, back to the cracks in the Martian soil they crawled from, mandibles tucked between their six legs.

""But...who?"" The commander asks

The cloaked figure turns slowly with an odd whirring sound and lowers its hood.

""Impossible!"" The wide-eyed commander declares, ""You were lost over a hundred years ago! They said you were dead!""
