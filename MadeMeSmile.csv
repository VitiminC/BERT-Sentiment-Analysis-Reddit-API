38,Take your country back from the Oligarchs!!,
39,"Has this invasion catalyzed a possible public uprising in Russia? Seeing these protests give me hope that the Russia being portrayed in the news now is not backed by its public that recognizes the tyranny and corruption it’s hiding.

45,"Wanted to DM you this but hey ho.

I was homeless myself in London in the 80's eventually worked in a hostel then rehousing. The reason most people lost their new place was inviting their 'friends' from the hostel or streets round. 

They treated the place as party central and that was usually ok it was interactions with neighbours. 

Be sure who you invite round, set a rule, see if they agree.If they laugh or won't agree please don't let them come round.

I hope everything is great and enjoy that safe feeling when you lock the door and sleep. Take care and stay safe.",

53,I think people who cook underestimate the value of homemade food to people who don’t cook much.,
54,"Hey, that’s me! Lol.",
55,"I think the key between creepy and cool is that the mom is aware of the entire situation. Based on the post, the games are occurring outside where all can be seen, and the adult isn't asking the kids to keep their hangout-time a secret.

58,"The reason I have a kid right now is because a random kid walked up to me on a cruise ship and wanted to play ping pong. I was playing with my wife, and this little boy, maybe about 6, wanted to play.

It was a very chaste ceremony with no kissing and we had garden raspberries for our reception.

In case you were wondering what the license plate said, it had the letters ""YDHT"" which stands for ""You Didn't Have Too"".

124,"My father lived alone after my mother died, So for one Christmas I decided to buy him a little dog, something to look after and to love, take for walks and get a bit of exercise.

I got a shih tzu, they are good companion dogs and it was the only suitable breed the pet shop had. Before Christmas I toilet trained the little thing, first getting him to do his biz on newspapers then moving the papers to the door then outside. He got the message eventually. When he had an accident he'd hide under the bed in shame and have to be coaxed out.

He was the perfect gift, my dad wasn't parted from the dog till his death, 14 years later.   
I inherited the now elderly dog.   
I was a bit resentful, I had a young family and enough problems, but the little dog got under my skin and became my favourite member of the house. Always pleased to see me, jumping up and running in circles when I walked in the door from work, always happy.

As he aged he wouldn't be able to rush up to greet me, and had to be carried up and down the stairs, all he could do is push his head into me.
the last night he lost the use of his back legs. It was time to let him go. I let him sleep on the bed with me that night.

next morning I couldnt find him.
What broke my heart is he'd dragged himself off the bed in the night to do his biz on a old newspaper I'd casually discarded on the floor, but didnt quite make it and left a puddle... then just like all those years ago, he crawled under the bed in shame and there he died.

If only I'd woken up and told him not to worry.

127,Best dance ever,
128,"If you're able to, look into being a foster for your local Humane Society.

The animals available for fostering are generally either awaiting a medical procedure, or recovering from one. It's an easy and cost-free process that can provide a home and time out of shelter until the animal is medically cleared to be up for adoption. From my experience the foster time frames are for as little as a few days to a couple weeks, quite approachable for people that love animals but can't commit to owning one.

I just completed fostering my first doggo for a couple weeks while he recovered from a hip surgery, it was a great experience.",

181,"Great stuff. I did a similar thing on a much smaller scale near my old home where I walked my dog. 

Every day I would pick up a handful of litter and drop it in the bin. It was just a small thing every day, no real effort, I just made it my mission every walk to pick up some trash on my way, a little every day. 

After a few months it started to change noticeably, there was very little rubbish and most importantly I found that when an area is clean -people typically don’t tend to litter as much. It’s as if the existence of litter there already means that the litterer feels somehow permissioned to just add ‘one more’.

After a year or so I got more ambitious, I started climbing into bushes and up the less accessible slopes of the creek looking for rubbish, until all of it was pristine. A few years later, some time after I moved away from that house, when I returned I was so happy to see my little area I adopted was still clean. So proud of that.",

I also am a beekeeper and I tell them to stay away from my bees and my foodplot I have alfalfa and clover planted for the bees and deer. They went abs did donuts on my foodplot tearing it up. So I started shutting & locking the gate. Then they busted the lock & snuck in so I got some 2x6 boards and out 4” screws in them and barrier them on the trails with just the screws sticking out. I flattened a lot of tires. I haven’t had anybody on me  in 3 weeks now. I live on the land to so if I’m outside I know they’re here. Disrespectful a-holes.,

I would sit with her while he went to get water since it was so hot. She’d repeatedly ask where he was and I would repeat that he went to get water etc. Other vendors commented on my patience.  I told them it isn’t hard. She isn’t annoying. She literally can’t remember she already asked. It was super hot that weekend so I would buy them those orange pushpops and we would eat together. She was so happy and so excited. He thanked us at the end of the event. Sadly the next year I learned he had passed away but his son had taken over and was with his mom. We didn’t get the chance to talk and I didn’t want to stress her out by asking if she remembered us. It takes nothing to be kind.",

205,"Why did the sentence ""She felt so pretty"" just make me cry like a baby?",
206,"When i was in cosmetology school, q woman came in for just a smille manicure. I got her ticket and shortly after I started, she was crying. I stopped for a moment and asked her if she was okay, she said this was the first time she's gotten a manicure in 8 months and the first since her daughter passed from cancer. She talked about her daughter, her love for animals, her favorite colors, and how they would have a spa day every month until she got sick. After I was done and walked her back to the front, she bought a few things from me and then asked if she could hug me. I let her and she just held me and squeezed for a few minutes and then thanked me. 

One of my teachers seen and asked if i knew her, I told her no, and explained what happened, she also hughed me and told me that I probably made her so happy. She came back in a week later and gave me a $10 tip from the week before and a sunflower from her daughters funeral because I mentioned how I love sunflowers and that was also her daughters favorite. 

This profession can suck, but it can be very rewarding. Ive had a few stories similar but this one really stuck with me and 2 years later, I still think about her from time to time.",
207,"Am a hairdresser. One of my seasoned co-workers told me a story when I was first starting out about how when she was still kinda new, she had a normal day of clients, had a new lady come in for the first time to get her hair cut and styled. 
She said the appointment was real normal, just basic questions about herself and casual nice small talk and getting to know each other. The lady left and didn’t book another appointment. 
She got an email about a week later from the lady telling my co-worker that she probably didn’t realize the impact that she had on people and how just being nice could change everything. The woman had come to get her hair done because she was going to kill herself that night and didn’t want her family to have to worry about getting her made up for a funeral. 
She felt entirely different after that appointment and made sure to tell my coworker that she was the reason she decided not to go through with killing herself that night. 
Story has always stuck with me. Kindness goes a hell of a long way.",

214,"I got divorced when my daughter was 3. In addition to every-other-weekend visits, I had dinner with her every Wednesday night. For 15 years, I'd take off work early to drive from the city out to the suburbs to pick her up from school or crew practice or her mom's at 5 and have her back by 7.

She went off to college, and called me on the first Wednesday away at 5:00. She was surprised I was still at work. Halfway through the sentence ""I thought you got off work early on Wednesdays,"" she got it.",
215,Good man right there. I live in the forest and my girlfriend's little girl is 8. So when she comes to visit I hide some crystals down by the creek and tell her that's where the fairies play and leave her gifts... her happiness = our happiness,
216,Finally figured it out… I am enlightened,
217,My grandfather had a lollipop tree. He lived across the country so we'd only get to visit every couple years. But every time we'd run to the backyard to pick lollipops from the lollipop tree. It probably wasn't until I was 9 or 10 that I realized lollipops don't grow on trees.,

This conflict has brought him so close to his people in such a real and tangible way that it sets a whole new precedent for interacting with his staff members and his people as a whole.  


Part of me would hope that this would encourage other world leaders to ditch the CEO-style appearance and professionalism and occasionally actually interact with their people. I know that wont happen though.",
