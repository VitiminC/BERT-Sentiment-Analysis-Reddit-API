38,Take your country back from the Oligarchs!!,
39,"Has this invasion catalyzed a possible public uprising in Russia? Seeing these protests give me hope that the Russia being portrayed in the news now is not backed by its public that recognizes the tyranny and corruption it’s hiding.

45,"Wanted to DM you this but hey ho.

I was homeless myself in London in the 80's eventually worked in a hostel then rehousing. The reason most people lost their new place was inviting their 'friends' from the hostel or streets round. 

They treated the place as party central and that was usually ok it was interactions with neighbours. 

Be sure who you invite round, set a rule, see if they agree.If they laugh or won't agree please don't let them come round.

I hope everything is great and enjoy that safe feeling when you lock the door and sleep. Take care and stay safe.",

53,I think people who cook underestimate the value of homemade food to people who don’t cook much.,
54,"Hey, that’s me! Lol.",
55,"I think the key between creepy and cool is that the mom is aware of the entire situation. Based on the post, the games are occurring outside where all can be seen, and the adult isn't asking the kids to keep their hangout-time a secret. 

I've always liked the idea that ""it takes a village"". This seems like a good community with both the kids and adult getting an enriching experience out of the games.",

58,"The reason I have a kid right now is because a random kid walked up to me on a cruise ship and wanted to play ping pong. I was playing with my wife, and this little boy, maybe about 6, wanted to play.

It was a very chaste ceremony with no kissing and we had garden raspberries for our reception.

124,"My father lived alone after my mother died, So for one Christmas I decided to buy him a little dog, something to look after and to love, take for walks and get a bit of exercise.

I got a shih tzu, they are good companion dogs and it was the only suitable breed the pet shop had. Before Christmas I toilet trained the little thing, first getting him to do his biz on newspapers then moving the papers to the door then outside. He got the message eventually. When he had an accident he'd hide under the bed in shame and have to be coaxed out.

He was the perfect gift, my dad wasn't parted from the dog till his death, 14 years later.   
I inherited the now elderly dog.   
I was a bit resentful, I had a young family and enough problems, but the little dog got under my skin and became my favourite member of the house. Always pleased to see me, jumping up and running in circles when I walked in the door from work, always happy.

As he aged he wouldn't be able to rush up to greet me, and had to be carried up and down the stairs, all he could do is push his head into me.
the last night he lost the use of his back legs. It was time to let him go. I let him sleep on the bed with me that night.

next morning I couldnt find him.
What broke my heart is he'd dragged himself off the bed in the night to do his biz on a old newspaper I'd casually discarded on the floor, but didnt quite make it and left a puddle... then just like all those years ago, he crawled under the bed in shame and there he died.

If only I'd woken up and told him not to worry.

128,"If you're able to, look into being a foster for your local Humane Society.

The animals available for fostering are generally either awaiting a medical procedure, or recovering from one. It's an easy and cost-free process that can provide a home and time out of shelter until the animal is medically cleared to be up for adoption. From my experience the foster time frames are for as little as a few days to a couple weeks, quite approachable for people that love animals but can't commit to owning one.

I just completed fostering my first doggo for a couple weeks while he recovered from a hip surgery, it was a great experience.",

181,"Great stuff. I did a similar thing on a much smaller scale near my old home where I walked my dog. 

Every day I would pick up a handful of litter and drop it in the bin. It was just a small thing every day, no real effort, I just made it my mission every walk to pick up some trash on my way, a little every day. 

After a few months it started to change noticeably, there was very little rubbish and most importantly I found that when an area is clean -people typically don’t tend to litter as much. It’s as if the existence of litter there already means that the litterer feels somehow permissioned to just add ‘one more’.

After a year or so I got more ambitious, I started climbing into bushes and up the less accessible slopes of the creek looking for rubbish, until all of it was pristine. A few years later, some time after I moved away from that house, when I returned I was so happy to see my little area I adopted was still clean. So proud of that.",

I also am a beekeeper and I tell them to stay away from my bees and my foodplot I have alfalfa and clover planted for the bees and deer. They went abs did donuts on my foodplot tearing it up. So I started shutting & locking the gate. Then they busted the lock & snuck in so I got some 2x6 boards and out 4” screws in them and barrier them on the trails with just the screws sticking out. I flattened a lot of tires. I haven’t had anybody on me  in 3 weeks now. I live on the land to so if I’m outside I know they’re here. Disrespectful a-holes.,

I would sit with her while he went to get water since it was so hot. She’d repeatedly ask where he was and I would repeat that he went to get water etc. Other vendors commented on my patience.  I told them it isn’t hard. She isn’t annoying. She literally can’t remember she already asked. It was super hot that weekend so I would buy them those orange pushpops and we would eat together. She was so happy and so excited. He thanked us at the end of the event. Sadly the next year I learned he had passed away but his son had taken over and was with his mom.

I let her and she just held me and squeezed for a few minutes and then thanked me. 

One of my teachers seen and asked if i knew her, I told her no, and explained what happened, she also hughed me and told me that I probably made her so happy. She came back in a week later and gave me a $10 tip from the week before and a sunflower from her daughters funeral because I mentioned how I love sunflowers and that was also her daughters favorite.

207,"Am a hairdresser. One of my seasoned co-workers told me a story when I was first starting out about how when she was still kinda new, she had a normal day of clients, had a new lady come in for the first time to get her hair cut and styled. 
She said the appointment was real normal, just basic questions about herself and casual nice small talk and getting to know each other. The lady left and didn’t book another appointment. 
She got an email about a week later from the lady telling my co-worker that she probably didn’t realize the impact that she had on people and how just being nice could change everything. The woman had come to get her hair done because she was going to kill herself that night and didn’t want her family to have to worry about getting her made up for a funeral. 
She felt entirely different after that appointment and made sure to tell my coworker that she was the reason she decided not to go through with killing herself that night.

My Mom retired so that lady’s job would be saved. I think I was 20 at the time.

422,"I worked as a framer while going to college, and after I graduated and started an office job, I volunteered for Habitat for Humanity.  I have to say, those houses are built really well; great insulation, framing is well thought-out, and overall good designs.  They may be a charity, but they certainly don't cut any corners on these residences for families who qualify.  President Carter's homes are built to last.",

So you want to applaud them, because even if there’s no one there, they still managed to graduate and deserve recognition. But you can’t tell which ones won’t be getting applause until it’s too late. So you just clap for everyone, and if it’s quiet, you turn it up a little. It’s exhausting, actually.

Edit to correct typos",
532,My children went to a high school that had many children with limited to no family. Our group totals over 10 at graduations. We make it a point to loudly cheer for everyone because we understand that a lot of kids have no one there. 10 people can make a lot of noise!!,

Bit of a potentially uncomfortable question, but did you happen to have any issues with loose skin after your weight loss? I’m a bit of a heavy gentleman myself, and that’s a bit of a fear of mine with starting to lose weight.",
544,How much fasting and how much walking? This is impressive and I really need to do something like this myself...,
545,I'm sure you know this by now but for anyone else - if you're anxious about the gym just go. I promise no one who matters is going to care that you're there as long as you're using equipment properly. Most people are far too busy worrying about themselves.,
546,"What happened to all the skin?  That’s my fear is all the skin afterwards.  I don’t see any scars of surgery, so where is the baggy skin?",
547,Dude that’s awesome!!! That’s no easy thing! Keep kicking ass.,
548,I did this backwards,
549,">...through fasting and walking.

Thank you for doing this right.  Either this or the pool are the correct way to lose weight BEFORE you start working out.  If you are obese, you can seriously hurt yourself trying to run or do calisthenics/lift weights until you have worked that excess weight off.

Great job, OP.  You look fantastic.

Also, of general note, nearly a pound a day is a pretty extreme rate of loss, but consider the caloric intake shift and the amount of water weight that was probably at play here.  You usually want to see a pound a week for sustainable weight loss for the average person.  I would discourage most people from trying to achieve a pound a day.",

We get new stamp issues for each other in our respective countries and trade them back and forth with letters, and our conversations are 100% like this. His letters are basically my favorite thing. I'm sure my terribly broken Japanese reads the same to him. It's amazing the things you can talk about even with such basic communication. Right now we've been discussing our favorite musical pieces.

Edit: sorry guys, but I'm not sharing the letters. He didn't write them for an audience, and I'm going to respect that. I'd be mortified if someone shared MY terrible Japanese on the internet.

676,"I found a letter from my grandmother recently when cleaning out some things in our garage. It was from when I was struggling in school and she sent me some money to hire a tutor. She shared some of her struggles in school and said she would always find more if I needed it. 

I’ve kept the letter all these years, it’s been over 25, I think, since she sent it. She’s been gone for so long but that letter brought her back and filled me with a deep sense of being loved again. 

My wife and I are expecting our first child in September and I just hope that I can be as giving and supportive as my parents and grandparents were. I worry I won’t be able to give as much as my family gave to me, but it won’t be for a lack of trying.

Thanks parents, for all of the super incognito things you do to point your kids in the right direction and make them think it was they who chose to go that direction. They might not realize it now (or ever), but someday your child might look back and realize how much you shaped their lives from the background.",

Later, while in college, I read in bed, too. Fell asleep, slept uneasy, moved a lot. Accidentally pulled the still burning ikea lamp by it's power cable down to my blanket. It slowly singed itself through the blanket to my mattress, melted the material 7 cm deep, which is when I woke up to a smoke filled room.

Hastily got out to the corridor. Went in again to open the window. Slowly, some of the other student's from that accomodation turned up. At that time, most were happy noone got killed. Next day, and the following days, i was - jokingly - informed, that at least a small singing of my skin or a few blisters would have made the lingering stench of singed foam mattress more acceptable for the rest. ;)

Tony goes, ""Yes, he's my uncle actually."" 

At the time, I had no clue who the guy was, but the counselor was very intrigued. Kept asking Tony about Joe and the one question I remember him asking was, ""What's he like at family gatherings? Does he show up in a nice car or act like a movie star, etc?""

Tony was like, nah he's awesome. Always brings me a gift and asks about school. Sounded super down to Earth.

So I'm like, is your uncle famous? Tony asks if I've seen Home Alone and that the short robber with the fuzzy hat is his uncle. I'm like, oh cool. And then we just moved on from the subject.

875,"You know what’s an amazing sign of character? You hear you won a contest and will not be going home...and your first reaction is utter sadness for the other person who you beat.

To have a visual display of sadness, it shows that the goals you are pursuing in life are not merely to be superior to others ...but to master your passions for the sake of enjoying the experience.

It’s a sign that you deeply despise that sometimes, in order to pursue your dreams, our society requires others to have their dreams hindered. 

It’s a sign that at the end of the day, you genuinely live for the happiness of those around you, and lifting others up.

I don’t know the women that stayed on the show. I have no idea what context this episode was within.

But her sadness for the person she beat out... shows immeasurable character.

I really respect her for her character.",

He has criss-crossed the country so many times, giving out mowers and weedeaters and such to the kids that complete his fifty yard challenge, which is a whole thing that others have covered here.

898,Not to be 'that guy' but paying for her medication makes me sad. You need universal healthcare,
899,Obviously very kind of the men but I kinda want to point out how: Countries health costs are so high and the set income for citizens are so low that paying for lawn service is impossible. Basically you are forced to choose between healthy body or healthy lawn.,

905,People skip those shows but they were the most memorable part of our trip  (secret Disney trick:  Sit on the center aisle about 2/3 of the way back.  Apparently that's the sweet spot for the camera at the Monster's Inc. show if you want Mike to make fun of you.),

Kid: How do you breathe underwater?

Turtle: “uh I don’t that’s called drowning”",

908,"I remember going to this as a kid and I was old enough to know the turtle was just an animation, but I was stumped by how he was answering questions and moving in real time. Its a cool little exhibit Im glad its still going",

939,When you buy from a small business you are directly supporting the local shop owner and their family as opposed to your dollars going to increase the bottom line for a bunch of stock holders that are probably already extremely wealthy.,

Who's gonna tell them?",
943,"I live in a third-world country and we have always had free meals in schools. There's even a program that connects local farmers to schools, so a good portion of the food is fresh and local.  


ETA: To address some recurring questions: I live in Brasil; not every single school has this specific program with local farmers, but all schools serve 1-3 meals a day (quality will vary depending on funding I guess, I remember having full blown delicious meals or awful stale cookies and milk snacks depending on the school). For the people who don't like the term ""third-world"", it's just a fast descriptor that is readily understood by the American audience who thinks California doing what poor and underdeveloped countries have been doing for decades is somehow innovative.",
944,"I have zero problem with subsidizing nutrition, healthcare, preschool, and after-school supervision for all children.",

The fact that feeding our kids is viewed as exceptional should really make us reconsider what a society we live in.",

It's not like left guy is a weak person with no will power and right guy is a strong person who can do hard things. There was like, a 6 month period where he did all the strong person stuff, day in and day out, looking like the guy on the left, while his body just caught up. It's all the same guy.",

961,Good job man keep up the good work!,
962,"I was a bigger guy and lost a lot of weight and got healthy. 

Biggest tips I can give you: 

1) remember how good you felt after this workout, that self-confidence and satisfaction of a job well done will keep you disciplined. 

2) don't let one bad day take you off the rails, give yourself a lot of grace. You didn't workout yesterday? That's FINE, just get up and walk half a mile. It's quite literally infinity better than nothing. 

3) everyone over estimates what they can do in a month and under estimates what they can do in 3 months. You will make progress and stall and back slide and make even more progress. It's all part of the journey my friend. 

You got this!

Best of luck to you!",

992,The people who care want to be involved.,
993,"During one of my presentations, my spouse, who works in my field, asked me a really difficult question that made me discuss some of the weakest points of my research. I know it was to make me squirm a little, on purpose, but feedback I got afterward from reviewers was that my answer to that question was what convinced them I had done all the work I needed to do.
To which my spouse said “you’re welcome!”",
994,"My boss who was helping prepare me for a promotion did this. She was on my interview panel and knew some of my strengths and made sure to ask specific questions that she knew would highlight my skills to the rest of the panel. 

I got the job, but she’s now leaving the department for a much better opportunity. Super happy for her.

It’s great to be surrounded by people who build you up. Don’t forget to do it for others too.",

He also never told me I played well after the one orchestra concert I played in that he showed up to (in hindsight he probably only went because my parents were there).
